<h1>Society Viewer On-Line Help</h1>

<b>What is it?</b> <br>

The Society Viewer displays all the agents defined within the current
project, and the relationships between each other. <p>

<B>When should I use it?</B> <br>

The purpose of this viewer is to provide a graphical depiction of what
has been defined so far. Hence it can be useful if you want to verify
that the desired agents and relationships are in place. <p>

<B>How do I use it?</B>

<ul>
<li> The main window panel will contain an icon for agent defined so far.
The layout of these icons can be changed by dragging the icons, or choosing
one of the layout options from the <b>View Style</b> list. <br>
<li> To see or hide the inter-agent relationships click the appropriate
<b>Relational Links</b> checkboxes, this will show relations as arrows
between the agent icons.
</ul>
<p>

<B>The Toolbar Options</B> <br>

<img src="../../../gifs/generator/collapse.gif" hspace=16> <b>Collapse</b>
- collapses the icons of a selected hierarchical relationship. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/expand.gif" hspace=16> <b>Expand</b>
- expands any previously collapsed relationships. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/recompute.gif" hspace=16> <b>Recompute</b>
- moves the icons according to the current layout setting.<br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/redraw.gif" hspace=16> <b>Redraw</b>
- refreshes the screen, useful if display is corrupted. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/select.gif" hspace=16> <b>Select/Deselect</b>
- changes the state of those nodes within a selected area. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/selectall.gif" hspace=16> <b>Select All Icons</b>
- marks all icons as selected.<br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/hide.gif" hspace=16> <b>Hide Selected Icons</b>
- removes the currently selected icons from the display. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/show.gif" hspace=16> <b>Show Hidden Icons</b>
- shows all previously hidden icons. <p>

These options also have corresponding entries in the <b>View</b> menu.<p>

<B>The Layout Options</B> <br>

There are 4 possible arrangements for the agent icons, which can be selected
from the <b>Layout</b> list below the video controls. The default is a horizontal
arrangement, but this can be changed to one of the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Vertical</b> - this arranges the agents according to their hierarchical
position, i.e. subordinates are shown underneath superiors.
<li><b>H-Coworkers</b> - this arranges the agents so that those who are
co-workers are horizontally aligned. It will have no effect if no co-worker
relationships exist within the visualised society.
<li><b>H-Peers</b> - this arranges the agents so that those who are peers
are shown beside each other. It will have no effect if there are no peers within
the visualised society.
<li><b>Centered</b> - this will place the selected agent in the middle of the
screen with the other agents arranged in a circle around it. If no agent has
been selected the Visualiser will choose one.
</ul>
