<h2>Rule Editor Help</h2>

In ZEUS, a rulebase refers to a collection of precondition-action rules. This
editor can be used to add individual rules to a rulebase, and editing existing
rules, the latter activity typically involving the following steps:
<ul>
<li> Enter a new rules
<li> Enter the rule's trigger conditions
<li> Enter the rule's action consequences
</ul>

<h4>Entering a New Rule</h4>

To add a new rule click the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/new1.gif" hspace=16> 
button - this inserts a new entry into the table, which can be renamed to reflect
the function of this rule. If the rule is the selected entry in the rule table 
its conditions and actions can then be edited. <p>

<h4>Entering a Rule Condition</h4>

Rules are triggered in response to the detection of particular facts or variables.
A rule can have one or more conditions, which are entered as separate lines into 
the Conditions panel of the Rulebase editor. The easiest way to enter a fact is
to choose its name from the fact tree shown in the Ontology panel on the bottom
right-hand corner, then click on the Insert Fact or Insert with ID buttons. <p>


<h4>Entering a Rule Action</h4>

A rule's actions occur when the all the rule's conditions are satisfied, the
applicable actions can be chosen from the list on the right-hand side of the
editor and inserted by pressing the Insert Action button.  The syntax and
effects of the actions are explained in the ZEUS Realisation Guide.
