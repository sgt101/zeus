<h2>Primitive Task Editor Help</h2>

Once an entry for a task has been created it can be fully specified through
this editor. A primitive task is a representation of some atomic (non-divisible) 
agent activity, this is depicted onscreen as a resource flow, where precondition
facts flow into a task, whereupon they are transformed into effect facts. <p>

Using this editor the following aspects of a primitive task can be configured:
<ul>
<li>Preconditions	- the resources needed for execution of the task
<li>Effects - the resources that will be produced upon execution of the task
<li>Cost - an expression given the cost of executing the task
<li>Duration	 an expression giving the time taken to execute the task
<li>Precondition Ordering	- the sequence in which preconditions should be achieved
<li>Constraints	- applicability restrictions on executing the task
</ul>

As some of these aspects are dependent on each other, their definition is best
attempted in the order listed above. <p>

More informtion on the use of the Primitive Task Editor can be found in the
ZEUS Realisation Guide in the description of activity TASK-1.
