<h1>Planner & Scheduler  Viewer On-Line Help</h1>

<b>What is it?</b> <br>

The Planner & Scheduler  Viewer is a component that displays the agent's diary of scheduled goals.
The diary is a two-dimesional array, with time on one dimension and processors on another. The
agent schedules its activities over a finitie time period defined by the length of its diary,
and across a finite number of processors, given the width of the diary.

<p>



<B>How do I use it?</B> <br>
The Planner & Scheduler  Viewer consists of two panes. The diary is in the top pane
and the bottom pane provides a diagnostic information of an entry in the  diary. Thus when you click on an
entry in the diary, its corresponding diagnostic information will be displayed in the bottom pane. The
 top pane displays the ten most current entries in the diary. You can change this setting
 by specifying a range (less than default value of ten). The range is specified when you
 key in a value in the <I>to</I> textfield. The value must be greater or equal to the current time.
 To view the new settings click on the <I>Set</I> button.  Clicking on the <I>Reset</I> will
 change the setting  to the default value of ten.
