<h1>Code Generation</h1>

<b>Note:</b> As the information used to generate the agents is taken from the 
Agent Generator's internal model, you should ensure that changes to your project 
have been saved before attempting this stage. <p>

The Code Generation window allows the developer to configure the utility agents,
task agents through the following activities:
<ul>
<li> UTIL-1 : Configuring the Name Servers
<li> UTIL-2 : Configuring the Facilitators
<li> UTIL-3 : Configuring the Visualisers
<li> UTIL-4 : Configuring the Database Proxies
<li> TACF-1 : Configuring the Task Agents
</ul>

These are described in more detail in Sections 5 and 6 of the ZEUS Realisation
Guide. <p>

Once configured, the scripts, source code and rules that implement the agent
application can be generated. First choose where the source code will be written,
and the operating system that will run the agents, then generate the application
source code by clicking on the <i>Generate</i> button.  Messages reporting on
the code generation process will then appear in the "Generation Messages" panel
at the bottom of the screen. <p>
