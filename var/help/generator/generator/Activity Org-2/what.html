<h3>ORG-2: Entering Known Abilities </h3>

Whereas the <a href="../Activity Org-1/what.html">previous activity</a> dealt 
with the identities and relationships of acquaintances, this activity deals 
with their abilities.  This is particularly useful for setting up preferred 
supply relationships, since if an agent knows an acquaintance can provide a 
resource it contact it first before asking the directory service to recommend 
a supplier. <p>

To add a new ability, ensure the relevant acquaintance is selected and click 
the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/new1.gif" hspace=16> button. You can 
now edit the time, cost, and attribute values of the fact concerned.
