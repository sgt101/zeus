<h3>COORD-1: How to Equip an Agent with a Co-ordination Protocol</h3>

The ZEUS tool-kit provides pre-built co-ordination protocols that implement
various aspects of contract-net type conversations, and which are applicable
for a variety of agent applications.  The available protocols are listed in
the 'Co-ordination Protocols' panel. <p>

In this panel the 'Protocol' field refers to the Java file within the ZEUS
class library that provides the implementation of that protocol.  The 'Type'
field refers to the nature of the protocol, which in keeping with the model
of interaction presented earlier, will be either Initiator or Respondent. <p>

To equip the agent with a protocol just click on the check-box beside its
name, a tick will appear to indicate its selection, clicking again will clear
the selection. <p>

to select/unselect all the protocols. <br>

Once a protocol has been selected an entry will appear in the 'Co-ordination
Strategies' table, this is explained <a href="../Activity Coord-2/what.html">
here</a>.
