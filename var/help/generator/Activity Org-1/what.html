<h3>ORG-1 : Entering Known Acquaintances</h3>

This stage involves supplying this knowledge about other agents and their
abilities. Click the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/new1.gif" hspace=16>
button to add a acquaintance, and then select the most appropriate relationship
from the following:
<ul
<li> Peer	- the default relationship with no assumptions about agent interaction
<li> Superior	- the acquaintance is possesses higher authority than this agent, 
and can issue orders that this agent must obey
<li> Subordinate	- the acquaintance has less authority than this agent, and
can be issued orders that it must obey
<li> Co-worker - the acquaintance belongs to the same 'community' as this agent, 
and will be asked before peers when any resources are required
</ul>
