<h3>What is the Fact Hierarchy?</h3>

The Fact Hierarchy panel lists all the facts present in the
current ontology. Facts can be related to other facts by inheritence,
whereby a 'Child' fact will inherit the attributes of its 'Parent'. <P>

Note that the fact hierarchy is based on single inheritence, i.e. each
child has just one parent, although each parent can have multiple children.
As parents are themselves children they will have inherited attributes
from their own parents. <P>

The hierarchy of Parents and Children is represented as a tree using the
following icons:<P>

<img src="closedfolder.gif" hspace=16> the closed folder represents a
Parent whose children are not currently shown on screen. This saves space,
and is the default state for all parent facts. To show the children - click
on the "+" icon, or double-click on the fact's name.<p>

<img src="openfolder.gif" hspace=16> the open folder depicts a Parent
whose Children are shown underneath. To hide the children click on the "-"
icon, or double-click on the fact's name.<p>

<img src="../../../gifs/ontology/cloud.gif" hspace=16> a cloud is used to 
depict a Child fact: these are facts that have not (yet) been used to 
define other facts. <p>

<p>
Clicking on a Parent or a Child fact will cause its attributes to be displayed
in the <a href="../attribute table/what.html">Attribute Table</a> panel below.
