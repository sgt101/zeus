<h3>How to Create a New Attribute</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the fact to which the attribute will be added is the selected
node of the fact hierarchy,  if not, clicking on the fact selects it.  The
existing attributes for the selected fact will then appear in the Attribute
Table beneath the Fact Hierarchy window. <p>

<li><img src="../../../gifs/ontology/new.gif" hspace=16> Click on the "New"
button in the toolbar above the Attribute Table.  This will create a new 
entry in the table, double-click on it to rename it as appropriate. <p>

<li><img src="../../../gifs/ontology/row1.gif" hspace=16> and
<img src="../../../gifs/ontology/row2.gif" hspace=16> Clicking on the
'Toggle Shown Attributes' will hide or show the attributes inherited from
the fact's parents.  This can be useful for determining whether an attribute
has already been declared higher in the fact hierarchy. <p>
</ul>
