<h3>What is the Attribute Table?</h3>

The Attribute Table lists the attributes of the fact selected from the Fact
Hierarchy panel above. There are two viewing modes: <P>

<img src="../../../gifs/ontology/row1.gif" hspace=16> <b>Show Specific Attributes</b>.
This is the default option. When this is selected the table will show
attributes which are specific to the currently selected fact alone,
i.e. attributes inherited from the parent will <i>not</i> be shown. <br>
<P>

<img src="../../../gifs/ontology/row2.gif" hspace=16> <b>Show All Attributes</b>.
When this option is selected the table will show every attribute possessed
by the currently selected fact. Attributes shown in <b>black</b> are
specific the currently selected fact; whilst attributes shown in
<b><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT></b> will have been inherited. Note that
inherited attributes can not be edited. <br>
