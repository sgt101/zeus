<h3>How to Restrict an Attribute</h3>
<p>Attributes can be restricted by either <a href="../restriction table/editing.html">
creating a restriction rule</a> or by associating an individual attribute with
its own restriction, to achieve the latter.. </p>
<ul>
<li>Double click on the "Restriction" cell of the attribute entry, this will 
open a small green-coloured panel through which the restriction can be typed.
</ul>

<p>The syntax of restrictions is that of a simplified expression, details of
which are provided <a href="../../glossary/expressions.html">here</a>.</p>
