<h3>How to Create a Restriction</h3>

<p> Restrictions are entered through the table in the Restriction Definitions
pane of the Ontology Editor, thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new restriction by clicking on the <img src="../../../gifs/ontology/new.gif" hspace=16>
New button, this will create a new entry in the table. <p>
<li>Then double click on it to edit its name to something more appropriate. <p>
<li>Now set the type of the restriction by double clicking on its "Type" cell,
this brings up a window with a hierarchy of current restrictions and basic
types, (see <a href="../attribute table/editing2.html">How to Set the
Type of an Attribute</a> for details). Facts can not be chosen as a type. <p>
<li>Now double click on the "Restriction" cell, this opens a small green panel
through which the default value can be typed.  The syntax will be dependent on
the type chosen previously. <p>
</ul>

<p>The restriction will be syntactically checked upon entry, invalid entries
will be displayed in red.  The syntax of restrictions is that of a simplified
expression, details of which are provided
<a href="../../glossary/expressions.html">here</a>.</p>
