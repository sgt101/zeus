<h1>Task Declaration</h1>

This table is used to perform activity DEF-2, namely declaring (but not yet
actually defining) the application-specific tasks or rulebases that this agent
is capable of performing (or executing in the case of rulebases). <p>

Clicking on the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/new1.gif" hspace=16> button 
provides the choice of entering either a new Primitive task, new Summary task, 
new Rulebase, or choosing a task that has already been entered. A new entry 
will then appear in the table using a temporary name, to rename the task to 
something more meaningful, double click on its name field.
