<li> Clicking the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/new.gif" hspace=16> button
will clear the current ontology from memory. You will be given an opportunity to
save it before it is cleared.

<li> Clicking the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/load.gif" hspace=16> button
will open a file requester enabling you to select which previously saved ontology
to load into memory. If there is an existing ontology in memory you will be
asked to confirm its deletion.

<li> Clicking the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/savedisk.gif" hspace=16> button
will save the current ontology to disk. If it is being saved for the first time
a file requester will open enabling you to select its physical location.

<li> Clicking the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/edit.gif" hspace=16> button
will launch the Ontology Editor and create a new (empty) ontology if none is
resident in memory.
