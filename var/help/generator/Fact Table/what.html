<h1>About the Fact Entry Table</h1>

This Fact Entry table consists of two components, the upper table contains a 
lists of fact-type : name pairs, whilst the lower table lists the attributes
of the entry selected in the upper table. <p>

Naturally, before a fact can be inserted into the table it must have been
defined as part of the application ontology.  Then to enter a new fact
click on the <img src="../../../gifs/generator/new1.gif" hspace=16> button,
this opens a window showing the fact hierarchy of the project ontology from
which the appropriate fact can be chosen. <p>

Following this the fact will appear as a new entry in the upper table, the
Fact Type field can not be changed, but the Instance field can be edited to
enter a more appropriate name. Note that the @ character prefix indicates that
the fact is an individual instance, (and not any instance, which would be
prefixed by a ? character).  The fact's attributes can then be individualised
by editing the Value cells of the lower table. <p>

Note: Faster editing of Value fields is possible by right-clicking the field
during editing, this opens a window showing the ontology's fact/attribute
hierarchy, allowing specific facts and attributes to be clicked on rather
than typed in. <p>
