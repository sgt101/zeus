<h1>Statistics Tool On-Line Help</h1>

<b>What is it?</b> <br>

The Statistics Tool allows the user to analyse the behaviour of the agents, 
either whilst the society is still running, or offline using previously
saved agent activity sessions. It operates by collecting copies of inter-
agent messages, which are then processed and displayed in one of the several
available presentation formats. <p>

<B>When should I use it?</B> <br>

The Statistics Tool provides a means of investigating the behaviour of a multi-
agent system. One application may be to learn about how the agents operate,
and the type and frequency of the messages exchanged. Alternatively, it can
function as a debugging aid, to determine why an agent system is not working
as expected. <p>

<B>How do I use it?</B>

<ul>
<li> Before using the Statistics Tool ensure the list of all known active agents
has been obtained from the Agent Name Server. The instructions for this process
can be found <a href="../common/ans.html">here</a>. <br>
<li> To make the Visualiser aware of on-going agent tasks it must contact each
known agent to request progress updates.  To do this, select the <b>Request
Messages</b> option from the <b>Online</b> menu. This will bring up a dialog
enabling you to choose which agents will be analysed by the Statistics Tool. <br>
<li> With data now being streamed to the Visualiser you may choose which aspect 
of the agent society to analyse. The supported perspectives can be selected
from the <b>Statistics</b> menu. <br>
<li> Once an aspect has been chosen, the format in which it is displayed on
screen can be chosen from the <b>View</b> menu. <br>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Available Presentation Formats</h4>

Whilst some statistics can only be presented in certain formats, others have a
choice of presentations. The available formats can be chosen from the toolbar or
the <b>View</b> menu: <br>

<img src="../../../gifs/visualiser/pie.gif"   hspace=16> <i>Pie Chart</i> <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/visualiser/line.gif"  hspace=16> <i>Line Graph</i> <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/visualiser/xy.gif"    hspace=16> <i>XY Cluster Graph</i> <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/visualiser/table.gif" hspace=16> <i>Tabular Chart</i> <br>
<p>

<b>Other Menu Options</b>

<ul>
<li> The activities displayed live by the Report Tool can be saved to a file to
be replayed later; this process is described <a href="../common/savetodb.html">
here</a>. Instructions for loading a previously saved session are listed
<a href="../common/loadfromdb.html">here</a>. <br>
<li> The statistics obtained can be made more specific by ignoring particular
received messages. This is achieved by choosing the <b>Filter Messages</b> 
option from the <b>Options</b> menu, and then choosing which agents or which 
messages to ignore.<br>
<li> To stop receiving messages from any or all agents, select the
<b>Unrequest Messages</b> option from the <b>Online</b> menu. <br>
</ul>
