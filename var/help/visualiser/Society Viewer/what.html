<h1>Society Viewer On-Line Help</h1>

<b>What is it?</b> <br>

The Society Viewer is a Visualiser component that displays all the agents
known within a society, their relationships and the communication occurring
between them. It operates by periodically querying agents about their
acquaintances, and by collecting copies of any messages that are sent between
agents. <p>

<B>When should I use it?</B> <br>

The Society Viewer's high level view of agents provides an ideal summary of a
multi-agent system. It provides an 'at a glance' depiction of all the agents
known to the Visualiser and the messages sent, as the agents send them.  The
continual flow of messages can provide reassurance that the agents are still
functioning, which otherwise may be difficult to verify given their potential
distribution across a network. <p>

<B>How do I use it?</B>

<ul>
<li> If you haven't yet connected to an Agent Name Server, no icons will be
present in the main panel.  In which case, follow <a href="../common/ans.html">
these instructions</a>, this will retrieve the list of known agents. <br>
<li> There should now be at least two icons in the main window panel. The layout
of these icons can be changed by dragging the icons, or choosing one of the
options from the <b>Layout</b> list. <br>
<li> To see messages exchanged by the agents the Visualiser must contact each
known agent to request they send it a copy of every message sent.  To do this,
select the <b>Request Messages</b> option from the <b>Online</b> menu. This will 
bring up a dialog enabling you to choose which agents' messages are displayed. <br>
<li> If you have requested messages from a Facilitator agent you should soon 
see message icons moving between it and the other agents as it sends queries 
to update its ability model.<br>
<li> To see the inter-agent relationships click the appropriate
<b>Relations</b> checkboxes, this will show relations as arrows between the
agent icons. The viewer's relationship model can be updated by choosing the
<b>Update Relations</b> option from the <b>Online</b> menu. <br>
</ul>
<p>

<B>The Toolbar Options</B> <br>

<img src="../../../gifs/generator/collapse.gif" hspace=16> <b>Collapse</b>
- collapses the icons of a selected hierarchical relationship. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/expand.gif" hspace=16> <b>Expand</b>
- expands any previously collapsed relationships. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/recompute.gif" hspace=16> <b>Recompute</b>
- moves the icons according to the current layout setting.<br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/redraw.gif" hspace=16> <b>Redraw</b>
- refreshes the screen, useful if display is corrupted. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/select.gif" hspace=16> <b>Select/Deselect</b>
- changes the state of those nodes within a selected area. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/selectall.gif" hspace=16> <b>Select All Icons</b>
- marks all icons as selected.<br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/hide.gif" hspace=16> <b>Hide Selected Icons</b>
- removes the currently selected icons from the display. <br>
<img src="../../../gifs/generator/show.gif" hspace=16> <b>Show Hidden Icons</b>
- shows all previously hidden icons. <p>

These options also have corresponding entries in the <b>View</b> menu.<p>

<B>The Layout Options</B> <br>

There are 4 possible arrangements for the agent icons, which can be selected
from the <b>Layout</b> list below the video controls. The default is a horizontal
arrangement, but this can be changed to one of the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Vertical</b> - this arranges the agents according to their hierarchical
position, i.e. subordinates are shown underneath superiors.
<li><b>H-Coworkers</b> - this arranges the agents so that those who are
co-workers are horizontally aligned. It will have no effect if no co-worker
relationships exist within the visualised society.
<li><b>H-Peers</b> - this arranges the agents so that those who are peers
are shown beside each other. It will have no effect if there are no peers within
the visualised society.
<li><b>Centered</b> - this will place the selected agent in the middle of the
screen with the other agents arranged in a circle around it. If no agent has
been selected the Visualiser will choose one.
</ul>

<i>Note:</i> As some of these layouts are dependent on agent relationships they
will not function until the Visualiser is aware of each agents' relationship
with others. This information is requested by choosing the <b>Update Relations</b>
menu option. <p>

<b>Other Menu Options</b>

<ul>
<li> The activity displayed live by the Society Viewer can be saved to a file to
be replayed later; this process is described <a href="../common/savetodb.html">
here</a>. <br>
<li> Instructions for loading a previously saved session are listed
<a href="../common/loadfromdb.html">here</a>. <br>
<li> To stop receiving messages from any or all agents, select the <b>Unrequest
Messages</b> option from the <b>Online</b> menu. Alternatively, the <b>Filter
Messages</b> option can be chosen from the <b>Options</b> menu. <br>
<li> The <b>Options</b> menu also has a <b>Speed...</b> option, which allows
the speed at which the messages are animated to be set, (the smaller the value
entered the faster they will be displayed). <br>
<li> The <b>Animation Type...</b> menu option enables the on-screen
representation of messages to be selected. There are three choices: as icons,
colour-coded letters, or colour-coded lines. <br>
</ul>
