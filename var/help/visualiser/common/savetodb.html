<h3>About the DbProxy Agent</h3>

The information collected by the Visualiser can be saved to a file, to be
loaded and replayed later. Session persistence is provided by a special
utility agent called a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><i>DbProxy</i></FONT>, which
in its simplest form can be started with the following syntax: <br>

<pre>java zeus.agents.DbProxy <i>name</i> -s <i>serverfile</i> -p zeus.ext.FlatFile 
</pre><p>

where <i>name</i> is the identifying name of the DbProxy agent <br>
and   <i>serverfile</i> contains the address of an Agent Name Server <p>

The reference to <i>zeus.ext.FlatFile</i> instructs the DbProxy to save session 
information into an ASCII text file, although it is also possible to save 
sessions to relational databases, (see main documentation for details). <p>

<h3>Saving Visualiser Sessions</h3>

<ul>
<li> Once a DbProxy is running a new session entry can be created by selecting the
<b>Save Session</b> option from the <b>Playback</b> menu. <br>
<li> A dialog will now appear asking for the identifying name of the Proxy
agent that will store the session; enter its name in the <b>SelectDBProxy</b>
field. <br>
<li> You must now choose the name that will be used to identify this session,
enter this into the <b>Select Table</b> field. This enables one agent to be
responsible for storing several individual sessions.<br>
<li> Once the session has been created all agent activity will be logged and
stored by the DbProxy. The session can be closed by choosing the <b>Close
Session</b> option from the <b>Playback</b> menu. <i>N.B.</i> Nothing will be
written to the named file until this option is selected. <br>
</ul>
<p>

<img src="../../../gifs/visualiser/rec.gif" hspace=16> The <b>Record</b> button
provides a short-cut to the <b>Save Session</b> option. <p>

Instructions for loading a previously saved session are listed
<a href="../common/loadfromdb.html">here</a>. <p>

Other options from the <b>Playback</b> menu enable previously saved sessions
to be deleted through the <b>Delete Session</b> option. Alternatively, all the
saved sessions stored by a particular agent can be cleared by selecting the
<b>Purge Database</b> option. <p>
