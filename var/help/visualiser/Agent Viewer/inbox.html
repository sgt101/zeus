<b>The Incoming Mail Box</b> <p>

<b>Role</b> <p>

The Incoming Mail Box (aka InBox) provides Zeus agents with their primary
means of communication with the outside world. By default Zeus agents communicate
by exchanging ACSII formated messages through TCP/IP sockets, this lightweight
mechanism has been deliberately chosen in preference to more complex RMI or
CORBA mechanisms, which may have required additional software to be installed.
(Although as the InBox and <a href="outbox.html">OutBox</a> encapsulate the
communication mechanism it would be possible to replace it with an alternative,
although this could restrict compatibility with other agents). <p>

<b>Display</b> <p>

The Inbox window consists of a table whose rows represent the last 10 incoming
messages to be received. The following information is shown:

<ul>
<li><i>Sender</i> - the name of the agent that dispatched the message
<li><i>Subject</i> - a summary of the content of the message
<li><i>Type</i> - the <a href="../../glossary/performative.html">performative</a>
type of the message
</ul>
