<h1>Control Tool On-Line Help</h1>

<b>What is it?</b> <br>

As the Control Tool is effectively an online version of the <I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
Agent Generator</FONT></I>, it enables users to modify the internal states of
agents at run-time. <p>

<B>When should I use it?</B> <br>

Whilst modifying an agent whilst it is still running may seem dangerous, the
declarative nature of ZEUS agents means changes can be incorporated whilst 
still preserving the integrity of the agents concerned. There are several 
scenarios when making such changes might be desirable :

<ul>
<li> <i>Giving Orders</i> - if the agent does not have its own user interface
this tool can be used to issue instructions. <P>
<li> <i>What Ifs</i> - when you want to experiment and modify an aspect of an
agent, but you don't want to recompile it. <P>
<li> <i>Administrative Management</i> - the tool can be used for administrative
tasks, like killing or suspending agents. <P>
</ul>

<B>How do I use it?</B>

<ul>
<li>Before using the Control Tool ensure that the list of all known active agents
has been obtained from the Agent Name Server. The instructions for this process
can be found <a href="../common/ans.html">here</a>. <br>
<li>If the Visualiser was not supplied with an ontology when it was started choose
the <b>Load Ontology...</b> option from the <b>File</b> menu. This will summon a
file browser, locate the appropriate ontology file and then click on the
<b>Open</b> button. <br>
<li>The Control Tool is now ready for use, its options can be selected from the
menu or toolbar. <br>
</ul>
<p>

<b>Using the Menu Options</b> <br>

All the operations of the Control Tool can be selected by choosing the appropriate
menu entry. The menu options list the five aspects of an agent society that
can be modified, namely:

<ul>
<li> <a href="goals.html">Goals</a>
<li> <a href="definition.html">Definition</a>
<li> <a href="organisation.html">Organisation</a>
<li> <a href="coordination.html">Co-ordination</a>
<li> <a href="society.html">Society</a>
</ul>
<p>

<b>Sending Commands</b> <br>

There are several ad hoc commands (i.e. non-standard Agent Communication Language
commands) that can be sent to agents using the <b>Send Commands...</b> menu option.
This dialog window allows a choice of which agents will receive the command, and
a textfield for entering the command itself, this can one of the following:

<ul>
<li> <pre>kill_yourself</pre> - instructs the recipient to cease running gracefully
<li> <pre>db_del</pre> - instructs the recipient to clear its resources database
<li> <pre>db_reset</pre> - makes the recipient re-initialise itself
<li> <pre>optimise</pre> - causes the recipient to optimise its schedule
</ul>
<p>

<b>Using the Toolbar Buttons</b> <br>

Alternatively, the toolbar icons provide shortcuts for the more frequently
used operations, namely: <P>

<img src="../../../gifs/control/kill.gif" hspace=16> <b>Kill Agents</b> -
selecting this option will send messages to every known agent instructing it
to cease running. This is a useful option for elegantly ending an application
regardless of where its processes are located. <P>

<p>The other icons will be documented when they become functional.</p>
