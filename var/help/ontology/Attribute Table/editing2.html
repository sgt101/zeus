<h3>How to Set the Type of an Attribute</h3>
<p>Types serve to restrict the set of valid values the attribute can take, and
will be one of the basic types, a restriction or another fact.  The basic
types have been predefined as: <br>
<ul>
<li>String: any combination of alpha-numeric characters, plus the _ and $
characters only
<li>Integer: whole numbers in the range -2147483648 to +2147483647
<li>Real: all numbers in the range 4.94e-324 to 1.798e308
<li>Boolean: the words true or false
<li>Date: numerically expressed in the European format: dd/mm/yyyy, (i.e. 2
digits for day/ 1 or 2 for month/4 for year). Terms can also be separated by
dashes, i.e. dd-mm-yyyy.  ZEUS is millennium compliant.
<li>Time: numerically expressed using the 24-hour clock format, as either
hh:mm:ss, (i.e. 1 or 2 digits for each of hours:minutes:seconds).  Seconds
can be omitted, and hh:mm used instead.
</ul>
<p>Restrictions are custom types used to further restrict the values taken by
the basic types.  These are entered separately, see
<a href="../restriction table/editing.html">How to Create a Restriction</a>.</p>
<p>When attributes need to assume more complex values, their type can be
specified as a particular fact.  All previously entered facts are listed
under the "Facts" node of the type selection window. </p>

To set the type of an attribute:
<ul>
<li>Double-click on an entry in the Attribute Table, this will summon a window
showing all a hierarchy of currently known types.
<li>Then select the type required and click the <b>OK</b> button.
<ul>
