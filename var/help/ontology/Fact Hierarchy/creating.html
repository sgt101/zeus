<h1>How to Create a New Fact</h1>

<P>The first stage in creating a new fact is to determine its position within 
the existing fact hierarchy. </P>
<ul>
<li> If the new fact has no parents in the existing hierarchy you will 
typically choose the Entity node and click on the 
<img src="../../../gifs/ontology/newsub.gif" hspace=16>Add New Child Fact button.
</ul>
<p>The Entity fact is used to represent concepts that have physical realisations,
like objects and commodities.  Where this is not appropriate the ZEUS fact
hierarchy also has a fact called Abstract that does not possess cardinality
and value attributes. </p>

<ul>
<li>If the new fact inherits from an existing fact, select the parent node and
click on the <img src="../../../gifs/ontology/newsub.gif" hspace=16>
Add New Child Fact" button. <p>
<li>Alternatively, to make the new fact share the same parent as another,
(a useful short cut), select the existing fact and click the
<img src="../../../gifs/ontology/newpeer.gif" hspace=16>Add New Peer Fact button.<p>
</ul>
<p>A new entry will now appear in the fact tree, double click on it and rename
to whatever is appropriate.</P>
