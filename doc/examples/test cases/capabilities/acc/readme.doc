ACC Readme file. 

Running this demo.

To run this demo use the runServers, runAgents and runVis batch files. 
Wait for the demo to initialise (count to 10 slowly), and then type test, 
this will start the test agent which will send ten copies of a message 
via iiop to the zeus agents. Shortly after 10 replies will come back . 

Known problems 

1. The test program has all the style of a chimp with scurvy. 
2. The envelope part of the messages is (ahhem) poorly implemented as of yet. 
3. The implementation a bit of a dogs dinner. 

Actions in progress

1. Effort to handle envelopes somewhat better. 
2. Effort to refactor implementation (this ties in with a larger ongoing "let's clean Zeus up, 
ohmygod my brain will explode if I have to deal with this code any more" effort).
