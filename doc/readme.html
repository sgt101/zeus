<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>You have at your fingertips the ZEUS Agent Building Toolkit -
an integrated development environment for creating multi-agent
systems. It is the result of several years' work by members of
the BT Labs' Intelligent Systems Research Group. </p>

<p>It is also the product of an ongoing open source effort under
this license. <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ZeusAgent/">This ZeusAgent
page </a>at sourceforge should give you some more information on
what we are up to, and also access to resources such as bug
fixing and support for your vital technical questions. </p>

<p>So far ZEUS has been used on several projects at BT and by a
number of external groups. There experiences have driven the
evolution of the toolkit, and contributed to the system that you
have today. However, we are keen to continue the development
process so: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Do the development tools facilitate the rapid engineering
        of agent applications? If not - how can the development
        methodology be improved? </li>
    <li>Are the prewritten agent components robust and useful? Do
        they function efficiently and correctly? If not, how can
        they be improved? </li>
    <li>Are the agents provided by ZEUS suitable for a variety of
        distributed applications? And if not, what features need
        to be added? </li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>The file you have unpacked to obtain this Readme file contains
one other file: an 'InstallShield' self-extracting archive
containing the ZEUS toolkit. To extract the toolkit you must have
a <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/">Java 1.2</a>
(aka Java2) runtime environment installed on your system. ZEUS is
then installed using the following command: </p>

<pre>java zeusinstall</pre>

<p><strong><u>Ensure that the current directory '.' appears in
your CLASSPATH, otherwise the Java interpreter will not be able
to run the installer</u></strong> </p>

<p>This will launch the 'InstallShield' installation program that
should be familiar to PC users, then just follow the onscreen
instructions. Most of the installation is automatic, although you
will be prompted to choose where to install the toolkit. </p>

<p>We recommend installing into a directory called 'zeus', (e.g.
d:\zeus on PCs or /home/you/zeus on Unix). The install directory
should be a complete path, i.e. including the partition letter on
PCs, or relative to / on Unix. </p>

<p><b>Important Note for Existing Users: </b>If you already have
an earlier version of ZEUS installed on your machine the
installer will overwrite it. So if you have made any changes to
the examples applications - move them to another location for
safe-keeping before installing the new version. </p>

<h4>Changing your CLASSPATH</h4>

<p>Before you can run the ZEUS example applications or the ZEUS
Generator tool you must modify the CLASSPATH environment variable
used by your Java interpreter so it can locate the ZEUS class
files. This involves adding the following: </p>

<pre>
$INSTALL_DIR$/lib/zeus.jar:$INSTALL_DIR$/lib/gnu-regexp.jar
</pre>

<p>Where $INSTALL_DIR$ is the location you have chosen to install
ZEUS; the instructions for this process are also displayed during
the installation process. </p>

<p>your classpath should look something like:</p>

<p>.;..;c:\java1.2\bin\rt.jar;c:\zeus\lib\zeus.jar;c:\zeus\lib\gnu-regexp.jar</p>

<p>In WindowsNT classpaths are changed by opening the System icon
on the Control Panel. Switch to the Environment pane, and edit
the Variable and Value fields to set the classpath. Check the
lists of variable values before making a new entry, and append
the zeus.jar and gnu-regexp.jar entries to any pre-existing
setting. if you have no setting then make variable and value into
something like: </p>

<p>variable := classpath </p>

<p>value := .;..;c:\java1.2\bin\rt.jar;c:\zeus\lib\zeus.jar;c:\zeus\lib\gnu-regexp.jar</p>

<p>press Set, then Apply and then OK. </p>

<p>You can also set a class path by typing </p>

<p>set classpath = &quot;.;..;c:\java1.2\bin\rt.jar;c:\zeus\lib\zeus.jar;c:\zeus\lib\gnu-regexp.jar&quot;</p>

<p>in a dos window. But please note: this setting will only apply
to that window, and only for the life span of the window. </p>

<p>In UNIX the classpath value is set in .cshrc/.bashrc/.tcsh
file according to the syntax of those particular shell. Contact
your sysadmin for help if you are unsure. </p>

<p>Classpath values on Macs are a mystery to me. </p>

<h3>The ZEUS Package</h3>

<p>The installation process writes the following directories into
the specified installation location: </p>

<p><b>api </b><br>
This directory contains JavaDoc documentation of the application
programmer's interfaces provided within the top-level ZEUS
packages. These packages contain classes that developers are
likely to interact with when writing their own program code. The
undocumented packages are unlikely to be of interest to
developers. </p>

<p><b>docs </b><br>
The ZEUS documentation consists of several large files, and so
they are not currently included in the standard ZEUS distribution.
Instead, they can be downloaded from our web pages and saved in
this directory. The available ZEUS documents are listed and
hyperlinked <a href="docs/documents.html">here </a>. These
include several Case Studies that describe how the sample
applications were built, how they are run, and how they work. </p>

<p><b>examples </b><br>
This contains the source code and support files for the example
applications. </p>

<p><b>gifs </b><br>
This contains the 256-colour icons used throughout the toolkit,
as well as the embedded graphics within the on-line documentation.
</p>

<p><b>help </b><br>
This directory contains the hypertext files of the on-line help
documentation. As all the help files are written in HTML they can
also be read off-line using a web browser, the sub-directories
are organised by subject to facilitate this. </p>

<p><b>lib </b><br>
This directory contains 2 Java archive (JAR) files: <br>
zeus.jar - which holds the compiled class code for the toolkit <br>
gnu-regexp.jar - classes needed by the GNU regular expression
parser </p>

<p>Both these files must be known to your Java interpreter for
the toolkit to be used. During the installation you will be shown
instructions on how to add the locations of these files into your
CLASSPATH environment variable. </p>

<p><b>source.zip </b><br>
This is a zip archive file containing all the ZEUS source code.
As the toolkit has already been compiled into the lib/zeus.jar
file, this provides a logical way of separating the core ZEUS
code from the application code written by developers. Hence the
ZEUS source code is only intended for reference purposes and to
facilitate debugging. If you intend modifying ZEUS this archive
can be unzipped into a directory called 'zeus' (to preserve the
package names) and recompiled. As we retain the canonical version
of the source code, please send us any bug-fixes or improvements
you make, and we will consider incorporating them. </p>

<p><b>licence.html </b><br>
The open source licence under which ZEUS is distributed. </p>

<p><b>readme.html </b><br>
You're reading it. </p>

<p><b>getting-started.txt </b><br>
Guidance on what to do once the toolkit is installed. </p>

<p>Another file created during installation, but not written into
the installation directory is... </p>

<p><b>.zeus.prp </b><br>
This contains the parameters that configure the ZEUS toolkit, the
contents of which will only be of interest to advanced users.
This file is written into your home directory, this is ~ on Unix
machines, \winnt\profiles\yourname\ on NT machines and c:\windows
on Windows 95. You can test whether this file can be correctly
created by running the ZeusPrpTest Java program located in the
examples directory. The first line of the .zeus.prp file is the
most important as it tells the ZEUS toolkit where it has been
installed. If you move the ZEUS directory make sure you update
this file with its new location. </p>

<h3>The ZEUS Mailing List</h3>

<p>We have recently created a mailing list for ZEUS users, which
is hosted by <a href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk">Mailbase</a>, a
UK-based academic mailing list server. The objectives of the
mailing list are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>to enable ZEUS users to share information, expertise and
        ideas </li>
    <li>to provide a better means of technical support, (all
        technical queries should be addressed to the list, which
        will facilitate collaborative problem solving) </li>
</ul>

<p>All messages sent to the mailing list will be archived and
readable online from the <a
href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/zeus/">mailing list home
page</a>. The mailing list has deliberately been left open, so
you don't have to subscribe to post, and anyone can read the
archived messages through the web page. But if you'd like to join,
you'll find instructions listed <a
href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/zeus/join.html">here</a>.
Our hope is to be able to build a virtual community of ZEUS users
that will do for collaborative agents what Aglets did for mobile
agents. </p>

<h3>What's Missing</h3>

<p>The v1.03b, just as v1.02, distribution of ZEUS has some
functionality not present in this release that was present in
previous versions. The omissions are: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The Control Tool - although present in the early ZEUS
        prototypes the inclusion of new Agent Generator
        components have meant this needs to be reimplemented. </li>
    <li>The Remote Viewer - this client-server version of the
        Agent Viewer is shown as one of the options of the
        Visualiser Hub, but is not yet implemented. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully the missing components should be ready in time for
the next maintenance release, along with the remaining gaps in
the documentation. </p>

<h4>Known Bugs</h4>

<dir>
    <li>When running the ZEUS Generator in Windows the Java
        interpreter has been known to occasionally crash - we are
        unsure whether this fault is a JDK bug or a problem with
        our code. To avoid frustration we recommend that you save
        the contents of the Generator frequently. <p>Inevitably
        some bugs in our own code will exist, so if you find any
        please send a report of the problem to either <a
        href="mailto:lyndon@info.bt.co.uk">Lyndon Lee</a> (if you
        don't want to announce it to the world), or the <a
        href="mailto:zeus@mailbase.ac.uk">ZEUS mailing list</a> (if
        you do). The ZEUS team will then start investigating it. </p>
        <h4>Performance Issues</h4>
        <p>We have run ZEUS agents successfully on laptop PCs, so
        high-powered host machines are not anticipated as a
        requirement. But if there are many agents doing a lot of
        work, the load can be balanced by distributing them to
        different machines. </p>
        <p>But as the ZEUS agents (together with their Java
        Virtual Machine) have quite a large memory footprint and
        computational demand you might benefit from the
        performance enhancements offered by a JIT Java
        interpreter or the new <a
        href="http://www.javasoft.com:81/products/hotspot/index.html">HotSpot
        Virtual Machine</a>. </p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <hr width="50%">
        <h3>ZEUS in a Nutshell</h3>
        <p>The ZEUS toolkit is implemented by the object code
        within the zeus.jar file (in the zeus/lib/ directory).
        Logically, ZEUS consists of three separate functional
        parts: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>an Agent Component Library that implements
                various aspects of collaborative agent
                functionality, </li>
            <li>the Agent Building Environment - a suite of tools
                that facilitate the construction of multi-agent
                systems, and </li>
            <li>Visualisation tools that enable the agent
                applications to be observed and, where necessary,
                debugged. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A brief outline of these components is provided by our
        <a
        href="http://www.labs.bt.com/projects/agents/zeus/tour1.htm">online
        ZEUS tour</a>, whilst a more detailed description can be
        found in the ZEUS Technical Manual. </p>
