<h3><a name="1"></a>2  The Zeus Design Philosophy</h3>
<p class="text">The aim of the ZEUS project was to facilitate the rapid development
  of new multi-agent applications by abstracting into a toolkit the common principles
  and components underlying some existing multi-agent systems. The idea was to
  create a relatively general purpose and customisable, collaborative agent building
  toolkit that could be used by software engineers with only basic competence
  in agent technology to create functional multi-agent systems.  Thus, our design
  philosophy was to encapsulate the following principles:</p>
<li><p class="text">  Firstly,
  the toolkit should clearly delineate between <i>domain-level</i> problem solving
  and <i>agent-level</i> functionality. The latter covers the application-independent
  multi-agent issues such as communication, co-ordination, task execution and
  monitoring, exception handling, etc. while the former covers the acquisition,
  representation and use of domain-specific knowledge in problem solving. The
  intention being with the agent-level functionality provided, the developers
  could concentrate on implementing the domain-specific problem solving abilities
  of their agents.</p>
<li><p class="text">  Secondly,
  use of the toolkit should be based on the 'visual programming' paradigm. Hence
  the toolkit would support the agent creation process by providing structured
  menus and tables that would enable application developers to configure the functionality
  and modalities required of their agents as simply as possible.</p>
<li><p class="text">  Thirdly,
  the toolkit should support an open design to ensure it is easily extensible.
  Thus, expert users should be able to easily add to the library of agent level
  components, and configure new agents using a combination of user-defined and
  system-supplied components.</p>
<li><p class="text">  Fourthly,
  we intended to utilise ‘standardised’ technology wherever feasible, or be designed
  with standardisation in mind. We felt that standardisation was essential was
  for the industrial uptake of agent technology. This way, we envisaged components
  which could later be replaced with little difficulty by ‘more standardised’
  components. This is typified by our adoption of the most 'standardised' agent
  communication language currently available.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4>ZEUS Functional Requirements</h4>
<p class="text">Having briefly described our design philosophy, we now consider
  the requirements from the viewpoint of a user of the toolkit. Viewed from a
  user-centred perspective, it was required that the toolkit allow users to</p>
<ul class="text">
  <li> <i>configure</i> a number of different agents of varying functionality and behaviour;</p>
  <li> <i>organise</i> the agents in whatever manner using system-supplied organisational relationships;</p>
  <li> <i>imbue</i> each agent with selected system-supplied and/or user-defined communicative and co-ordination mechanisms;</p>
  <li> <i>supply</i> each agent with the appropriate application-specific problem solving code; and</p>
  <li> automatically <i>generate</i> the executables for the agents.</p>
</ul>
<p class="text">In addition, we also felt the toolkit should provide:</p>
<ul class="text">
  <li> predefined information discovery agents such as nameserver and facilitator agents
  <li> extensive facilities for visualising and debugging societies of ZEUS agents
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<h4>ZEUS Agent Assumptions</h4>
<p class="text">It is important to summarise at this point some fundamental
  assumptions made about the type of agents whose creation the toolkit is designed
  to facilitate, and also to describe the typical application domains of these
  agents.  The principal assumptions made regarding the agent behaviour are that
  the agents are:</p>
<ol class="text">
  <li> deliberative, goal-directed and rational;</p>
  <li> always truthful when dealing with other agents;</p>
  <li> versatile, i.e. can have many goals and can engage in a variety of tasks; and</p>
  <li> temporally continuous, i.e. have a well-defined lifecycle rather than being transient.</p>
</ol>

<p class="text">The agents should be deliberative in the sense that they
  should explicitly reason about their actions in terms of what goals to pursue,
  when to adopt new goals and when to abandon existing goals. In addition, the
  requirement for goal-directed behaviour implies the agents only select actions
  that they expect in some way to advance the attainment of their desired goals.
  Furthermore, they only abandon goals when certain either that they cannot achieve
  the goals or that the motivations for achieving the goals no longer hold. The
  rationality assumption implies the agents adopt only actions that they expect
  to maximise their expected utility.  That is, given a choice of actions, an
  agent would select a subset that it expects can be performed given the available
  time and resources, and further, that should lead to the maximum possible benefits.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h4>Typical Application Domains for ZEUS Agents</h4>
<p class=MsoList style='
text-align:justify;'>The typical application areas of the agents were expected
  to be task-oriented domains such as service provisioning, resource/process management,
  and supply chain management. A number of characteristics of these domains are
  important:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li> firstly, given a goal, an agent creates a plan of action to achieve the goal, and such
  plans require explicit reasoning about the preconditions and effects of domain
  actions given limited time and other resources;
<li> secondly, typical problem solving requires co-operation with other agents;
<li> thirdly, while the environment of the agent is dynamic, the rate of change of the environment
  is at least an order of magnitude less than the reasoning time of the agent.
  That is, there is a less than five percent chance that the external conditions
  on which a plan of action is based will change while an agent is in the process
  of creating the plan; and
<li> finally, the role of agents in such domains is typically to reason about how and when
  to configure, activate or deactivate external systems that perform the real
  work in the domain. Thus, domain problem solving is not really embedded within
  the agent <i>per se</i> but external to it.  The agent, in effect, possesses
  a logical model of the external system that it uses in making control and management
  decisions about the system.
</ol>

<p class="text">The next section describes the ZEUS toolkit that was
  developed to meet the above requirements. In subsequent sections we provide
  an example of the use of the toolkit, and then proceed to describe the design
  and implementation of the main components of ZEUS agents. <br>
<br>
 You may also find it useful to consult the accompanying case study documents, 
 which describe how the packaged example applications were built. </p>
