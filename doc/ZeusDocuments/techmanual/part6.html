<h3><a name="1"></a>6  The Planner and Scheduler</h3>

<p class="text">The role of the Planner/Scheduler is to construct action
  sequences that achieve desired input goals. The Planner is under the control
  of the Co-ordination Engine, which initiates planning and also manages the contracting
  of any subgoals that the agent cannot achieve.</p>
<h4>Plan Operator Representation</h4>
<p class="text">Planning operators (actions or tasks) are represented in
  the classical fashion as primitive or summary operators.  Primitive operators
  are defined in terms of their preconditions, effects, cost, duration and constraints
  and precondition order, while summary operators are defined in terms of an expansion
  or mini-plan (of existing primitive tasks). </p>
<p class="text">For planning efficiency, the preconditions and effects of
  operators can be qualified, just as variables and methods can take modifiers
  in programming languages).  Preconditions can be marked as:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> <b>read-only</b>, implying the condition is not consumed by the operator on execution, but simply read.<br>
<li> <b>local</b>, implying that the Planner can only apply the operator if it possesses the resource,
  or it can produce the resource on its own.  This means the agent cannot delegate
  production of the required resource to another agent. 
</ul>
<p class="text">Effect conditions can be marked as either public (the default)
  or private.  The Planner will select an operator to produce a desired effect
  only if that effect is marked public.  Hence side-effects should be marked as
  private to prevent the Planner from selecting the operator in order to produce
  such effects.  A good example is &quot;lying on the ground&quot; is a side-effect
  of hitting someone, but if the intention is to merely to instruct someone to
  lie on the ground, hitting them is a far from ideal way of achieving it. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="61"></a>6.1 Multi-agent Planning with Primitive Operators</h4>
<p class="text">The Planner utilises classical partial order means end planning
  in its plan construction process. (For a review of the planning literature see
  [8]).  Thus, given a goal of the form of Figure 6.1(a), the Planner searches
  its Plan Database for an operator with a public effect that unifies (with unification
  bindings q) with the desired_effect of the goal.  If multiple operators are
  found, they are ranked by cost, and then by duration. Next, the Planner selects
  the first ranked operator, constrains its preconditions and effects with q,
  and then attempts to schedule the operator into its diary.  If the operator
  cannot be scheduled, the Planner backtracks and repeats the process with the
  next applicable operator.</p>
<p class="text">The Planner’s diary is a two-dimensional array, with time
  on one dimension and processors on another, as depicted in Figure 6.1(b).  This
  approach (also used in job-shop scheduling), uses the principle that an agent
  will schedule its activities over a finite time period defined by the length
  of its diary, and across a finite number of processors, given by the width of
  the diary.  In the ZEUS implementation, processors are independent task execution
  threads. </p>
<p class="text">The scheduling of tasks into the plan diary is constrained
  by the end_time, the reply_time and the confirm_time of the goal.  The end_time
  specifies the latest time by which the desired_effect should be achieved; while
  the reply_time specifies the latest time by which the agent planning the task
  must inform the agent requesting the task whether it can perform the goal. The
  confirm_time specifies the latest time by which the requesting agent will inform
  the performing agent whether it has been awarded the contract.  </p>
<p class="text">Thus, operator scheduling starts from the end_time and progresses
  towards the confirm_time, utilising any free processors. Furthermore, the entire
  planning process must be completed (or else aborted) by the reply_time.  (The
  start_time is used in instances where a service agreement is being created.
  In such cases, one agent is requesting that another agent plan a task that will
  be executed <i>n</i> number of times at some future date, between some start_time
  and some end_time.)</p>

<p class="text" align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 6.1: </b>(a) The goal data structure. (b) A plan
  diary.</p>
<p class="text">If an operator is successfully scheduled into the plan diary,
  then the Planner will attempt to anchor all the preconditions of the operator,
  in the order mandated by the operator’s precondition ordering constraint.  A
  precondition can be anchored in one of four ways: </p>
<p class="text">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a resource in the Resource Database
  that unifies with the precondition can be reserved for it, or</p>
<p class="text">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a matching unused effect (i.e.
  a side effect) of a previously scheduled operator can be reserved for it, or
</p>
<p class="text">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an operator that produces the
  required precondition can be scheduled into the diary, or</p>
<p class="text">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an external agent can be found
  to produce the precondition. In the latter three cases, care must be taken to
  ensure that the required resource is produced before the operator needs it.</p>
<p class="text">The anchoring process can be illustrated with an example;
  assume an operator P has preconditions a, b, c, and d, and their order constraint
  enforces the ordering [a] -> [b, c] -> [d].  Thus, firstly, the resource a is
  checked against the Resource Database.  If a resource a* is found in the database
  that unifies with a (with bindings j), then a* is reserved for a.  The reservation
  process takes into account whether or not the operator P will consume the resource,
  and if it does, when that is scheduled to happen.  Thus, multiple read-only
  preconditions can reserve the same resource. </p>
<p class="text">Once a reservation is made for the resource a, the other
  preconditions and the effects of the operator P are constrained with the bindings
  j, and the next set of preconditions in the sequence, b and c, checked against
  the Resource Database.  Assume however that no resources matching b or c could
  be found in the database.  Next, the Planner checks its diary for any scheduled
  operators that produce b* or c* as unused side effects, and which are scheduled
  to complete execution before the operator P is scheduled to start execution. 
  Assume that a scheduled operator is found that produces b* within the required
  time window, but none for c*.  Now, b* is unified with b, and the unification
  bindings used to constrain further the operator P.  Also, the effect b* is reserved
  for b.  To deal with the precondition c, the Planner searches its Plan Database
  for any operators that produce c* as one of their public effects. If some operators
  can be found, the planning process proceeds recursively as described above. 
  If however, no applicable operators are available and the precondition c is
  not marked as local, then the planner creates a new subgoal to achieve c and
  adds the subgoal to a list of subgoals that must be achieved by other external
  agents.  If in the sequence of preconditions [a] -> [b, c] -> [d], c must precede
  d, and c has to be achieved externally, then planning is suspended for d until
  c is successfully contracted out.</p>
<p class="text">Thus, the planning process proceeds in the <b>backward chaining</b>
  manner described until one or more of the following conditions apply: </p>
<p class="text">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  the scheduler runs out of available processor space; </p>
<p class="text">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  all the preconditions in the plan either (a) have been allocated resources from
  the Resource Database, or (b) have been allocated side effects of previously
  scheduled operators, or (c) external subgoals have been created for them, or
  (d) plan operators have been scheduled to produce their required conditions;
</p>
<p class="text">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  the planning process has been suspended until some external subgoals have been
  contracted out. </p>
<p class="text">In any case, if a partial plan has been constructed, the
  planner will return to the Co-ordination Engine a list of subgoals that must
  be contracted out to other agents.  Once the results of the contracting process
  are returned to the Planner, it utilises them to progress the planning process
  by backtracking on plan branches with subgoals that could not be contracted
  out, and elaborating suspended branches that depended on successfully placed
  external contracts. The planning process only successfully terminates when there
  are no unanchored preconditions in the plan.</p>

<br>
<br>

<a name="62"></a><h4>6.2 Multi-agent Planning with Summary Operators</a></h4>
<p class="text">The plan construction process with summary operators differs
  somewhat from the case with primitive operators.  For example, consider that
  the summary operator of Figure&nbsp;6.2 is selected for inclusion in a plan
  in order to produce the effect g.  The Planner traverses the operator specification
  from right to left, following its precondition-effect links, and attempts to
  replace each node with a concrete (i.e. eventually primitive) operator.  Thus,
  it starts with node_4, and searches its Plan Database for other summary or primitive
  operators that have preconditions and effects that are supersets of the node’s
  preconditions and effects, respectively. </p>
<p class="text">Next, it ranks the applicable operators found and then selects
  the highest ranked one for inclusion in the plan; (the ranking criteria being
  by summary operators first, then by cost, and finally by duration).  If the
  selected operator is a summary operator, then this planning process is repeated
  recursively on it.  If, however, the selected operator is primitive, then the
  Planner attempts to schedule the operator into its plan diary.</p>
<p class="text">Once all the nodes in a summary operator have been replaced
  by primitive operators (either directly or by recursively expanding other child
  summary operators), the Planner then attempts to enforce the effect-precondition
  links between the nodes on their concrete images in its diary.  This serves
  to anchor some of the preconditions of the concrete primitive operators that
  form the expansion of the summary operator.  For example, the effect-precondition
  link between node_2 and node_4 of Figure 6.2 anchors the precondition, e of
  node_4.  Finally, the Planner attempts to anchor all remaining unanchored preconditions
  in the expansion; e.g. the precondition, b of node_2 or a of node_1.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='

<p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='
text-align:center'><b>Figure 6.2: </b>An example summary operator.</p>
<p class="text">The summary operator expansion mechanism described above
  is sufficient when a single agent is solely responsible for all operators in
  a plan. When multiple agents are involved, care has to be taken to ensure the
  correct routing of results that are produced by one agent but required by another. 
  For example, if during expansion of a given node of a summary operator there
  are no operators in the Plan Database that have preconditions and effects that
  match those of the node, then the Planner has to create a subgoal to achieve
  the required effects of the node externally.  For instance, if on expansion
  of node_4 of the summary operator of Figure 16 no operators can be found in
  the Plan Database that produce the effect, g, given inputs, e and f, then an
  external subgoal to produce, g, given e and f is created.  Note that in the
  case of subgoals for primitive operators, the subgoal statement was simply of
  the form <i>produce </i>a, whereas for summary operator nodes, subgoal statements
  are now of the form <i>produce </i>a<i> given </i>b.  Assume that the subgoal
  to produce g, given e and f, is successfully delegated to some agent A.  Further,
  assume that on expansion of node_3, again no operator could be found that produces
  the required effect, f, given input, d.  Again, assume the subgoal for this
  problem is successfully delegated to some other agent B.  Now, the planner has
  to ensure that agent B has the required precondition, d, for its portion of
  the task, and further, that agent B sends its result, f, to agent A, so that
  agent A can perform its portion of the task.</p>


<h4>Managing Resource Reservation Conflicts</h4>
<p class="text">The planner possess a mechanism to ensure the coherence of
  produced and supplied items when subgoals of the form <i>produce </i>a<i> given
  </i>b occur within multi-agent problem solving.  Typical conflict situations
  take one of two forms.  In the first case, consider that an agent A delegates
  to another agent B the task to produce x given y and z.  Now, in creating a
  plan to produce x, agent B makes a reservation of the expected supplied item
  y. At this point in its planning process, agent B has not reserved the expected
  input item z, and it cannot say whether it may need it in the future.  Further,
  as part of the plan to produce x, agent B needs to delegate to agent C a task
  to produce u, given v.  But, the item z is still available and conceivably,
  agent C might need it whereas agent B might not.  Thus, agent B delegates to
  agent C the task to produce u, given v and z. Now assume that in its plan to
  produce u, agent C reserves both v and z.  This makes z unavailable to agent
  B, and agent B must be notified of this.  Further, agent A must be notified
  to supply the input y to agent B and z to agent C (although agent A has no direct
  contract with agent C).</p>
<p class="text">In conflicts of the second form, consider that an agent A
  delegates to another agent B the task to produce x given y and z.  In creating
  a plan to produce x, agent B decides to delegate to agent C the task to produce
  u and to agent D the task to produce v.  At this point in its planning process,
  agent B does not need the expected inputs y or z, and it cannot say whether
  it may need either of them in the future.  So, because agents C or D might conceivably
  need y or z, agent B decides to delegate to agent C the task to produce u, given
  y and z, and to agent D the task to produce v, given the same y and z.  A conflict
  emerges if both agents C and D reserve the same resource y, for example.  It
  is the responsibility of agent B’s Planner to check the reservations made by
  both agents C and D to ensure there is no conflict. If a conflict is detected,
  only one of agents C or D is selected to perform its portion of the task, and
  the other portion delegated again with a revised list of supplied items.</p>

<br>

<a name="63"></a><h4>6.3     Execution Monitoring</h4>
<p class="text">Once a plan is constructed and scheduled for execution, each
  operator in the plan is executed in order at the operator’s scheduled execution
  time, or alternatively, before the scheduled execution time if there is a free
  processor available.  Operator execution, which is controlled by the Execution
  Monitor component, involves an invocation of the domain function specified in
  the operator’s specification.  The domain function, which is typically some
  legacy process, is invoked with the operator’s preconditions as its input arguments,
  and it is expected to return the declared effects of the operator.  The relevant
  output of the domain function (i.e. the operator’s effects) are then passed
  as input to the appropriate downstream operators in the plan sequence.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h4>Plan Execution and Exception Handling</h4>
<p class="text">An important role of the Execution Monitor is to detect failure
  during the scheduled execution of a plan. This can occur for a number of reasons:
</p>
<p class="text">(i)&nbsp; a resource reserved by an operator might be deleted, </p>
<p class="text">(ii)&nbsp; an operator might begin execution but fail to complete because of insufficient
  scheduled time or some other reason, </p>
<p class="text">(iii)&nbsp; an operator might successfully complete execution but return the wrong or incomplete
  results, or</p>
<p class="text">(iv)&nbsp; some promised resource from another agent might not arrive on time (or alternatively,
  the other agent might notify our agent that it can no longer provide the promised
  resource).  In either case, the net effect is that some precondition of an operator
  in the plan would lose its anchor.  </p>
<p class="text">In the case of the latter, if the Planner deems that it has
  sufficient time to replan before the whole plan goes out of schedule, then it
  initiates replanning.  Replanning essentially takes advantage of the Planner’s
  normal planning and backtracking mechanisms.  The Planner attempts to anchor
  the dangling precondition in one of four ways, either by:</p>
<p class="text">(i)&nbsp; allocating a new resource to it – if one can be found, or</p>
<p class="text">(ii)&nbsp; creating a new plan to produce the required resource, or</p>
<p class="text">(iii)&nbsp; creating a sub-goal to produce the required resource and contracting out the
  subgoal, or </p>
<p class="text">(iv)&nbsp; backtracking on the plan branch containing the dangling precondition. </p>
<p class="text">In the latter three methods, the replanning process may involve
  the placement of new contracts with other agents.  Furthermore, in the fourth
  method, some existing contracts might need to be cancelled if the new plan arrived
  at by backtracking no longer requires the results of those contracts.  If all
  four approaches fail, in which case the Planner cannot devise any plan to achieve
  the desired goal, it will try to contract out the original root goal itself. 
  If this also fails, the Planner is forced to report failure to the agent that
  originally requested the root goal.  It is worth noting here that the whole
  process of replanning and the potential costs of placing new contracts and cancelling
  existing ones might end up being very unprofitable for the agent.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"

<p class="text">Tables 6.1 and 6.2 present an example scenario illustrating
  some of the mechanisms involved in the exception handling process (although
  not included are situations where existing contracts need to be cancelled).</p>
