<h3><a name="1"></a>5 Agent Co-ordination</h3>

<p class="text">The component with the role of co-ordinating an agent's 
  activity with other agent’s is the Co-ordination Engine. It contains facilities 
  to manage the agent's problem solving behaviours, particularly those involving 
  multi-agent collaboration. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the general requirement for declarative specification of behaviour,
  the design of the Co-ordination Engine was governed also by the requirement
  that an agent should be capable of engaging in many tasks simultaneously.  This
  meant that the Engine should support some form of multi-tasking.  However, because
  of the costs involved, simple multi-threading was deemed inappropriate, since
  the number of independent tasks could potentially run into hundreds.  Thus we
  choose to represent problem solving behaviours as recursive transition network
  graphs, which are interpreted by a recursive finite state machine.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Problem solving behaviour representation and processing</h4>
<p class="text">Figure&nbsp;5.1 depicts a code fragment defining a simple
  graph and its equivalent pictorial representation.  As the figure shows, behaviour
  graphs are specified as networks of nodes interconnected by directed arcs. 
  The ZEUS representation of a graph is as a two-dimensional array of strings,
  where each string represents the fully qualified class name of the relevant
  node or arc. </p>
<p class="text">The processing of a graph involves starting from a designated
  start node and attempting to traverse the graph until a terminal node is reached. 
  The processing is controlled by a Graph class, which is the superclass of all
  behaviour graphs.  The nodes of a graph implement the processing points, while
  its arcs implement tests to determine whether traversal from one node to another
  is valid. Each node and arc accept an input argument on which they act to return
  an output argument. Thus, information follows through a graph from node to arc,
  in tandem with the traversal path. To allow for recursion, graphs are themselves
  also arcs; for example, in Figure&nbsp;5.1, the arc from S3 to S4 is a recursive
  invocation of simple_graph.</p>

<p class="text"><b>Figure 5.1:</b> (left) The Java code for the simple_graph data structure (right) the states of simple_graph.</p>
</center>
<p class="text">All nodes of a graph must implement two functions: an exec()
  and a reset() function.</p>
<ol class="text">
<li> The <tt>exec()</tt> function performs the core processing of the node, and returns one of the values
  OK, FAIL or WAIT. A return value of OK indicates that the processing at that
  node has succeeded, whereas FAIL indicates failure. A return value of WAIT,
  which must be associated with a timeout value and/or a message-reply-key, indicates
  that processing of the node must be suspended until the timeout period expires
  and/or a message with the specified message-reply-key is received.</p>
<li> The <tt>reset()</tt>
  function undoes any changes made on the input data by the exec() function ¾
  this is in order to support backtracking.</p>
</ol>
<p class="text">Arcs, on the other hand, must implement only a test() function
  that returns a Boolean value that indicates whether or not traversal of the
  arc is valid.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Multi-tasking</b></p>
<p class="text">In order to allow for the parallel processing of multiple
  graphs, control of processing of graphs is managed by a priority FIFO node-queue. 
  For example, processing of simple_graph of Figure&nbsp;5.1 proceeds as follows:
  the graph is launched by creating its designated start node (S1) using Java’s
  dynamic (runtime) object creation mechanism. Next, the input of the node is
  set to the argument passed with the launch command.  Now, the node is queued
  onto the node-queue to await execution.  Once the node is selected for execution,
  its exec() method is called, and if it returns OK, then the first arc emanating
  from the node (A1) is dynamically created. The arc is initialised with the output
  of S1, and its test() method called.  If the test() method succeeds, S2 is dynamically
  created, initialised with the output of A1, and queued onto the node-queue. 
  The use of the node-queue therefore allows many graphs to be executed simultaneously
  by interleaving node processing.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Parallelism</b></p>
<p class="text">Further parallelism is supported by a mechanism whereby certain
  arcs or graphs can be designated as parallel graphs.  For such an arc or graph,
  whenever its input is an array, then a (non-parallel) copy of the arc/graph
  is created for each element of the array.  The copies are managed in a <i>k-out-of-n</i>
  fashion, i.e. the parent arc/graph is traversed if <i>k</i> or more of its child
  copies succeed.  The value of <i>k</i> is specified in the definition of the
  parallel graph.  The parallel graph mechanism is particularly useful during
  delegation or contracting, where many independent jobs may need to be contracted
  simultaneously. </p>
<p class="text"><b>Backtracking</b></p>
<p class="text">To continue with our example, assume that when S2 is processed
  by calling its exec() method, it returns OK, however, when its first arc (A3)
  is executed it fails. In such a case, the processor attempts to backtrack by
  trying the next arc from S2. Since, S2 has no more arcs, its reset() method
  is called to undo any changes made by its exec() method. Next, its predecessor
  node (S1) is called to attempt traversing the graph by following its next arc
  (i.e. A2). Backtracking is also initiated whenever a node’s exec() method fails.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Communication</b></p>
<p class="text">In the graph framework, support for inter-agent communicating
  is achieved through use of the WAIT return value of a node’s exec() method. 
  For example, a node engaged in communication would send out a message and then
  ask to be suspended by returning WAIT with an associated timeout value or message-reply-key. 
  The node will then only be re-queued for processing when the timeout expires
  and/or a message with the required key is received.</p>
<p class="text">The recursive transition network approach used to define
  behaviour satisfied our requirements for declarative specification of behaviour
  and support for multi-tasking.  An alternative approach considered was rule-based
  processing; however this was rejected for a number of reasons.  First, while
  rule-based systems allow declarative specifications and parallel processing,
  the management of contextual information (i.e. the data on which decisions and
  actions are based) becomes confusing when multiple independent behaviours act
  on the same data.  Furthermore, this makes backtracking also difficult.  A final
  consideration in its favour was that we also believe the transition network
  representation is more intuitive.</p>

<a name="51"></a><h4>5.1 The Default Problem Solving Behaviour</h4>
<p class="text">The generic ZEUS agent comes equipped with a predefined goal-processing
  graph, this is depicted in Figure 5.2 and annotated in Table 5.1. 
  The graph controls basic problem solving behaviour for achieving goals in response to the 
  achieve() call made by the Co-ordination Engine component. <br>
  <br>
  It can be viewed as being logically composed of three phases: a resource allocation phase, a negotiation phase
  and a commitment management phase. Later in this section, the behaviour of this graph 
  will be explained with an example.</p>

<a name="52"></a><h4>A Graph Walkthrough</h4>

<p class="text">
  The default problem solving behaviour can be consider further by walking
  through the stages as they occur. <br>
  <br>
  Consider that a message is received by an agent to achieve
  a goal, x. Processing this message involves the agent’s Message Handler sending
  a request to its Co-ordination Engine to launch the default goal processing
  graph with the new message as its input argument. Launching the graph involves
  the creation of an instance of its designated start node (S1 of Figure 5.2),
  and the node’s input argument set to the new message. </p>
<p class="text">When executed, S1 first creates a data structure to hold
  the contextual information that will be generated as a result of processing
  the goal.  Next, the data structure is initialised with the goal’s parameters
  (taken from the content of the message passed as input to the node).  Now, the
  node calls the Planner/Scheduler to plan a sequence of actions to achieve the
  goal.  If the Planner has no competence whatsoever in dealing with the goal
  then the node fails, which in turn will cause the graph to fail.  </p>
<p class="text">Assume, however, that the Planner plans a sequence of actions
  to achieve the goal, but requires that some subgoals y and z should be achieved
  externally by other agents – this may be because of lack of time, competence,
  information or other resources.  Now, A2 is the only viable arc from S1, since
  its test condition that external collaboration is required (a non-empty list
  of external subgoals) is satisfied.  Thus we arrive at S2, where the agent prepares
  to contract out the subgoals y and z; this is achieved by executing A4.</p>
<p class="text">A4 is in fact defined as a 0<i>-out-of-n</i> parallel graph. 
  Thus, if its input is an array, then a (non-parallel) child copy of itself is
  created for each element of the array.  Therefore, with the sub-goals y and
  z as its inputs, independent child copies of A4 are created to handle each of
  y and z.  Secondly, by being defined as 0<i>-out-of-n</i>, the parent A4 is
  traversed if zero or more of its child copies succeed.  Thus, on contracting
  out y and z, the parent A4 will be traversed if none, one or both goals are
  contracted out.</p>
<p class="text" align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0 width=395 height=77
src="./gfx/image028.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"></p>
<p class="text" align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 5.3: </b>The
  A4 parallel graph.</p>
<p class="text">The graph defined by A4 (an example is shown in Figure 5.3)
  simply serves to provide a placeholder for the potentially many arcs/graphs
  that define the <i>initiator-side behaviour</i> of various negotiation protocols. 
  It could include, for example, arcs/graphs defining the contract manager’s behaviour
  at the request for proposals stage of the contract-net protocol, or the contract
  manager’s initial delegation behaviour in the master-slave delegation protocol.
</p>
<p class="text">As the graph processor attempts to traverse the first viable
  arc from S2a to S3a, the choice of negotiation protocol depends on two factors. 
  Firstly, the order in which the arcs from S2a to S3a are listed in the A4 graph
  specification, and secondly on whether the selected arc is indeed traversable
  in the given context.  The backtracking capability of the graph processor ensures
  that if viable arcs exist from S2a to S3a, then at least one will be selected. 
  In ZEUS, negotiation graphs (e.g. the initiator-side negotiation graphs in Figure&nbsp;5.3)
  typically comprise two main parts: an <i>applicability assessment</i> section
  and a<i> negotiation dialogue</i> section. The applicability section simply
  checks whether the protocol is applicable in the given context, while the dialogue
  section actually implements the protocol.</p>
<p class="text">Once A4 is traversed, at S3 the Planner is re-called with
  the results of the contracting process. Depending on its input, the Planner
  returns one of three possible results: </p>
<p class="text">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the planning process failed
  and no solution could be found for the original problem, </p>
<p class="text">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the planning process completed
  successfully and no further contracting is required, or </p>
<p class="text">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it might return a new list of
  subgoals to be contracted out, as well as a partitioned list of prior sub-contracts,
  some of which should be rejected and others that should be accepted.</p>
<p class="text">If further contracting is required, A5 will return the goal
  processor to S2 to begin a new phase of contracting.  If, alternatively there
  are no more subgoals to contract out and the planning process completed successfully,
  then A6 or A7 will be selected.  Which one gets chosen depends on whether or
  not the agent is trying to achieve the original goal x for itself or on behalf
  of another agent.  In the latter case, A6 is selected, which leads to S5.  </p>
<p class="text">At S5, some housekeeping functions are performed, in preparation
  for negotiation with the agent that requested that goal x be achieved.  The
  actual respondent-side negotiation<i> </i>is performed when A8 is executed. 
  A8 is in fact a placeholder for potentially many arcs/graphs that define different
  <i>respondent-side negotiation</i> behaviour. Again the ordering of the arcs/graphs
  (that replace A8) and the context determine which negotiation protocol gets
  selected.</p>
<p class="text">Following respondent-side negotiation (A8), at S6 checks
  are performed to determine that the agent has been awarded the contract, i.e.
  that an award confirmation message is received from the agent that requested
  goal x.  Next, A9 or A11 is traversed, depending on whether or not the goal
  x had any external subgoals.  Since in our example sub-goals y and z were contracted
  out, A9 is selected, leading to S4.  At S4, award confirmation messages are
  sent out to the agents selected to perform the contracted subgoals, and rejection
  messages sent out to those agents that did not get selected.  Finally, at S7,
  the plan constructed to achieve the goal x is scheduled for execution, and monitors
  are set up to manage the plan execution process.</p>
<p class="text">From the foregoing description, a couple of points should
  be clear. First, that the transition network representation makes it relatively
  easy for one to redefine, if needed, the basic goal processing behaviour outlined
  above. However, we believe our conceptual decomposition of the goal processing
  process into resource allocation (planning), negotiation and commitment phases,
  and our default graph are fairly generic and applicable in a number of domains.
</p>
<p class="text">Secondly, the transition network approach makes it easy for
  negotiation protocols and strategies to be added to a ZEUS agent.  Simply, initiator-
  and respondent-side negotiation graphs have to be defined for the protocol/strategy,
  and integrated into the default graph between S2a and S3a of Figure 5.3, and
  S5 and S6 of Figure&nbsp;5.2, respectively. In fact, the generic ZEUS agent
  already has some predefined negotiation protocols such as contract-net, master-slave
  delegation and some auction protocols.  Figure&nbsp;5.4 and Table 5.2 describe
  our current initiator- and respondent-side implementations of the contract-net
  protocol. In typical negotiation graphs, the negotiation strategy logic is defined
  within the exec() methods of the nodes in the graphs.  In some cases, this may
  even involve a call to external programs. The organisational relationships defined
  by Agent Component Library are typically used in the applicability test portions
  of negotiation protocol graph specifications.  For example, the applicability
  test portion of the initiator-side contract-net graph of Figure 5.4 mandates
  a preference for co-worker agents before peer agents when contracting out tasks
  (by the ordering of the arcs A1 and A2, where A1 precedes A2).</p>

<h3><a name="53"></a>The Default Rationality Model</h4>
<p class="text">It is worth briefly commenting on the rationality model implicit
  in the Co-ordination Engine and the default goal-processing graph.  Used as
  is, the default goal processing graph implicitly implements the following: </p>
<p class="text">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an agent would accept any goal
  for which it has the available resources to pursue, </p>
<p class="text">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the agent will continue accepting
  goals on a first-come first-served basis until its capacity to do so is exhausted,
  and </p>
<p class="text">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once an agent has accepted a
  goal, the agent is fully committed to the goal, and will do all in its power
  to ensure the goal is achieved. (As we shall see when discussing exception handling,
  the agent remains committed to an accepted goal even when it might no longer
  be in its best interest to remain so<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>).</p>
<p class="text">It is worth noting that the current version of the Co-ordination
  Engine has no explicit rationality model, i.e. there is no reasoning framework
  to determine from whom, and when to accept goals, or equivalently, when to abandon
  goals although they may be technically achievable.  Such a model, if needed,
  can be implemented by adding an agenda (and associated reasoning rules) to control
  (i) the conditions under which the goal processing graph is launched for goal
  selection, and (ii) the node-queue of the Co-ordination Engine for goal scheduling
  and abandonment control. The reasoning rules of the agenda should be essentially
  equivalent to the desire filter of the belief-desire-intention agent architecture
  [7]. Given the application domains envisaged for ZEUS, such an explicit rationality
  model was not deemed particularly necessary, although one is likely to be included
  in future versions of the system.</p>
