<h3><a name="1"></a>1  Introduction</h3>

<p class="text">The notion of heterogeneous autonomous agents collaborating
  to solve problems is a powerful metaphor for the engineering of distributed
  and interoperable software systems.  This agent-based approach introduces a
  new level of abstraction ¾ of knowledge level co-operation between autonomous
  systems ¾ that enhances distributed systems interoperability, scalability and
  re-configurability.   However, thus far, the promise of the agent approach has
  been largely unrealised in the distributed software engineering community. 
  This is due to a number of factors (including the current lack of standards
  for agent technology), but primarily because of the inherent complexity of constructing
  collaborative agent systems.</p>
<p class="text">To facilitate large-scale realisation of the collaborative
  agent approach to distributed software engineering we felt frameworks, methodologies
  and toolkits were needed that would support the rapid development of multi-agent
  systems.  This has led to the development of ZEUS, a toolkit for constructing
  collaborative multi-agent applications.  ZEUS is a culmination of a careful
  synthesis of established agent technologies to provide an integrated environment
  for the rapid development of multi-agent systems.  ZEUS defines a multi-agent
  system design approach and supports it with a visual environment for capturing
  user specification of agents that are used to generate Java source code of the
  agents.</p>


<a name="11"></a><h4>1.1 Issues For Builders Of Collaborating Agent Systems</h4>

<p class="text">The need for collaboration between agents occurs for any
  number of reasons; however, most are rooted in the problem of scarcity of resources
  – computing, information, know-how, etc. Since, individual agents possess different
  resources and capabilities, a solution to a given problem may be beyond the
  capabilities of any one agent, requiring that a number of agents pool their
  resources and collaborate with one another in order to solve the problem.  </p>
<p class="text">If such collaboration proceeds at the <a class="textlink" href="refs.html#1">knowledge level</a>
  it places significant demands on the agents. Not least are the need for a mechanism
  for information discovery through which agents discover the existence, network
  address, capabilities and/or roles of other agents; an agent-independent inter-agent
  communicating language that the agents use to communicate with one another;
  and an ontology that defines the application domain concepts being communicated
  between the agents. Furthermore, for effective and coherent problem solving,
  the agents need mechanisms for reasoning about their own and other agents’ problem
  solving capabilities and for co-ordinating their activities. In very dynamic
  environments, the problems are exacerbated by the additional requirements for
  data-driven reactive behaviour that integrates with the goal-driven deliberative
  activities of the agents.  Finally, in some application domains, agent systems
  may need to interface with legacy systems such as databases.</p>
<p class="text">Most of the issues associated with knowledge level multi-agent
  systems interoperation have received significant treatment, with a number of
  reasonably mature solutions or approaches proposed. In the following paragraphs
  we review the main techniques proposed for addressing the <i>information discovery,
  communication, ontology, co-ordination </i>and<i> legacy software problems</i>.
  Figure&nbsp;<b>1.1</b> is a context diagram illustrating the interplay between
  the various issues and their associated solutions.</p>

<p class="smalltext"><b>Figure 1.1:</b> Context diagram illustrating some of the
  issues involved in knowledge level multi-agent collaboration. The central agent
  needs to perform a complex task that requires it to collaborate with other agents.
  To do so, it uses the Facilitator to discover the agents with the required abilities,
  and the Agent Name Server to determine the addresses of these agents. The inter-agent
  communication language is used to communicate with the Agent Name Server, Facilitator
  and other agents. The communication requires a shared representation and understanding
  of common domain concepts, i.e. a common ontology.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h4>The Information Discovery Issue</h4>
<p class="text">
  This is typically handled using special-purpose utility agents such as <i>nameservers</i> and
  <i>facilitators</i> that function as society-wide white pages (address books)
  and yellow pages, providing a look-up service for agents’ addresses and abilities
  respectively. Thus, agents only need to register their address with a nameserver
  and their abilities with a facilitator to become visible to the society. For
  scalability and robustness, these utility agents might be arranged in hierarchies
  similar to that of Internet domain nameservers. In providing implementations of 
  these utility agents, Zeus allows the developer to concentrate on building the 
  application agents.</p>

<h4>The Communication Issue</h4>
<p class="text">The need for an agent-independent agent communication language
  (ACL) has led to the development of the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language
  (KQML) and the <a class="textlink" href="http://www.fipa.org/spec/index.html">FIPA ACL</a>.  Most ACLs do not specify a syntax or semantics
  of the contents of the messages, with the rationale being that different application
  domains may require different content languages.  Nonetheless, a number of general-purpose
  content languages have been developed, e.g. <a class="textlink" href="http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/knowledge-sharing/kif">KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format)</a>,
  typically used with KQML, and FIPA SL the preferred content language
  for use with the FIPA ACL. Zeus implements the 1997 release of the FIPA ACL.</p>

</p>

<br>
<br>

<h4>The Ontology Issue</h4>
<p class="text">
  Agents that communicate in a common language will still be <i>unable</i> to understand one another if
  they use different vocabularies for representing shared domain concepts.  Therefore,
  they also need to use the same ontology or vocabularies of common concepts. 
  This can be achieved either through general-purpose ontologies or by creating
  domain-specific ontologies and using inter-ontology translators to map between
  them.  The argument for the latter is that most general-purpose ontologies are
  unlikely to include the intricacies of all possible domains, and are likely
  to be large and unnecessarily complex for most applications.  </p>

<h4>The Co-ordination Issue</h4>
<p class="text">Co-ordinating the behaviour of multi-agent systems is an
  active area of research with many techniques in use.  The main approaches can
  be broadly classified as organisational structuring, contracting, multi-agent
  planning, and negotiation.  In organisational structuring the prior defined
  structure of the society (that is, the roles of the different agents and their
  relationships with one another) is exploited for co-ordination, as typified
  by client-server systems. Inter-agent coordination is handled by the Zeus
  <a class="textlink" href="part5.html#1">coordination engine component</a>. </p>
<p class="text">Contracting as a co-ordination mechanism is typified by the
  classic contract-net protocol, [5], where a manager agent announces a contract,
  receives bids from other interested contractor agents, evaluates the bids and
  awards the contract to a winning contractor.  Some interesting alternatives/variants
  to the contract-net protocol include various auction protocols such as the <i>english,</i>
  <i>dutch </i>and <i>double</i> auctions.</p>
<p class="text">In multi-agent planning, the agents utilise classical AI
  planning techniques to plan their activities, resolving any foreseen conflicts. 
  The planning normally takes one of two forms, centralised planning – in which
  a central agent performs the planning on behalf of the society, or decentralised
  planning – in which the agents exchange partial subplans, progressively elaborating
  the overall plan and resolving conflicts in it. Each Zeus agent possesses an
  internal <a class=textlink href="part6.html#1">Planner/Scheduler component</a>
  to formulate and execute its plans.</p>
<p class="text"> With negotiation,
  the agents engage in dialogue, exchanging proposals with each other, evaluating
  other agents’ proposals and then modifying their own proposals until a state
  is reached when all agents are satisfied with the set of proposals.  Typical
  negotiation mechanisms are based on game theory, on some form of planning, or
  on human-inspired negotiations.</p>

</p>

<br>
<br>

<h4>Integration with Legacy Software</h4>
<p class="text">As agents are not intended as replacements for legacy software,
  they must be able to interact with it.  Generally speaking there are three possible
  approaches: the software could be rewritten, but this is a costly approach.
  Alternatively a separate piece of software called a <i>transducer</i> could
  be employed to act as an interpreter between the agent communication language
  and the native protocol of the legacy system. Or thirdly, the <i>wrapper</i>
  technique could be used to augment the legacy program with code that enables
  it to communicate using the inter-agent language. Zeus uses the latter approach
  providing an interface through which all of its internal components can be
  accessed or linked to external systems.</p>

<p class="text">The sections of this manual return to these issues, explaining
how they are resolved within the Zeus toolkit.</p>
<p class="text">In <a class=textlink href="part2.html#1">Section 2</a>, we outline the philosophy and assumptions
  underpinning the design of our agent building toolkit. Furthermore, we specify
  the type of agent systems the toolkit is designed to create, as well as the
  class of application domains of these agents. </p>
<p class="text">In <a class=textlink href="part3.html#1">Section 3</a>, we describe the Zeus toolkit architecture;
  this section provides an overview of the design of the entire toolkit. We describe
  its Agent Component Library, which is used to implement the generic Zeus agent,
  the visual agent creation environment, and the suite of Zeus utility agents.
</p>
<p class="text">Later sections then describe the implementation details of 
  individual parts of the Agent Component Library, featuring the communication 
  manager, the co-ordination engine, the planner, the internal event model, and 
  the mechanisms for connecting to external (legacy) systems. </p>
