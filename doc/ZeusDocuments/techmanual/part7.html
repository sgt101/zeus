<h3><a name="1"></a>7 Integrating ZEUS Agents with External Programs</h3>
<p class="text">The preceding sections have mentioned the primary interfaces
  between ZEUS agents and external programs. These include the domain functions
  in primitive plan operator specifications, and user-defined Co-ordination Engine
  graphs whose nodes make direct calls to external programs.  Also mentioned was
  the fact that the Resource Database implements an interface that could be used,
  for example, with the database connectivity API of Java to link to proprietary
  databases – thus extending its potential size and functionality.  For routine
  problem solving within the declared scope of the ZEUS toolkit, it is expected
  that for the most part, these primary mechanisms will suffice.  However, the
  Agent Component Library also provides a secondary, more sophisticated interface,
  although employing it requires significant user programming. This done via a
  ZeusExternal interface class and an agent internal event model.</p>
<p class="text">The ZeusExternal interface class allows users to link an
  external Java class (that implements the interface) to an executing ZEUS agent
  program.  Once linked to the agent program, the external code can utilise the
  agent’s public methods to query or modify the agent’s internal state.  Thus,
  for example, the resource and/or plan databases can be queried or modified.
</p>
<p class="text">The TaskExternal interface class performs a similar function, 
  to allows users to link an external Java class that implements the 
  activity of a Zeus task. This interface also contains references to its
  owner agent, enabling the task to query or change its internal state.
</p>
<p class="text">The internal event model provides a mechanism whereby all
  significant events occurring in the agent can be monitored, e.g. planning events,
  resource, acquaintance and plan database events, message events, execution monitor
  events, and co-ordination engine events.  The internal event model is similar
  to the Java event model, whereby objects register an interest in receiving events
  of a particular type, and all subsequent events of that type are forwarded to
  the object.  So, using the event model, an external program that is linked to
  a ZEUS agent can monitor particular events in the agent and react to them, even
  by going so far as to use the agent’s public methods to make changes to its
  internal state.  Although the reader is forewarned that ZEUS currently does
  not even attempt to manage any internal inconsistencies that might result from
  such actions.</p>
<p class="text">The <b>ZEUS Application Realisation</b> guide provides several
  examples of how to use the event model. </p>

<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p class="text">
  The purpose of this document has been to explain the philosophy and
  functionality that underly the ZEUS toolkit. In particular, the way in which 
  the agent-level issues are encapsulated inside agent components, separate
  from application-level issues. This is deliberate, to enable developers to
  create working multi-agent systems more easily and efficiently. If others
  can use Zeus to build their own applications, our decision to employ a
  declarative specification of behaviour that is interpreted by the generic 
  ZEUS agent will have been vindicated.
</p>
<p class="text">Although this document provides an insight into how agent
  applications can be built from the toolkit components, it has deliberately avoided 
  discussing how agent applications should be designed.  There is also no description 
  of how tools such as the ZEUS Agent Generator tool can be used to create executable
  applications.  Instead, these are subjects dealt with in the ZEUS Methodology
  documents.</p>
