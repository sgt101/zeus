<p class="text"> Once the task and utility agents have been appropriately configured the next stage
  is to generate the application source code. </p>

<p class="text"><img width=32 height=32 src="./gfx/image067.gif"> &nbsp;
  This process again involves using the Code Generator tool, which is launched by selecting the &quot;Generate Code&quot;
  option from the Agent Generator's menu bar, or the equivalent button from the
  Project Options toolbar. The following activities can now be attempted:</p>

<p class="text">As the information used to generate the agents is taken from
  the Generator's internal model, you should ensure that the project has been
  saved before attempting this stage.  Code generation is achieved through the
  &quot;Generation Plan&quot; tab pane, as shown in Figure 6.1.</p>
<p class="text">Unlike most other tables of the Agent Generator, the main
  table of Figure 6.1 can not be edited.  Instead the function of this table is
  to display information on which agents and tasks will be created when the code
  generator tool is run next. </p>
<li> <p class="text"> <img width=32 height=16 src="./gfx/image087.gif"> &nbsp; To remove
  an agent or task from this list, go to the &quot;Task Agents&quot; or &quot;Tasks&quot;
  panes and uncheck the &quot;Generate&quot; checkbox beside the task or agent
  name.  </p>
<li> <p class="text"> Alternatively
  select the entry to remove and press the toolbar's Delete button.  Whilst selecting
  the Clear button at the top of the screen will remove all entries.   </p>
<p class="text">The table's type field provides an at-a-glance reference
  to the type of each entry; this will be Name Server, Facilitator, Visualiser,
  Agent or Task.  Clicking on the button in the toolbar above the table enables
  particular entry types to be hidden or shown.</p>
<p class="text">The next step is to decide where the source code will be
  written.  As the generator will overwrite previously generated files in the
  same location this should be chosen carefully.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> <img width=16 height=16 src="./gfx/image088.gif"> &nbsp; To change
  the destination of the generated source code click on the Change Target Directory
  button.  This will open a file dialog window, use this to navigate to the intended
  target directory.  Note however that a 'feature' within the current Java file
  dialog means you will need to choose a file within the target directory in order
  to make the selection. </p>
<li> <p class="text"> If no files
  exist within the directory you will need to choose its parent and specify the
  directory manually by editing the path that appears in the neighbouring text-field. 
  You may even find it quicker to type the whole path name into this field and
  ignore the file dialog option.</p>
<p class="text">The next action is to specify which operating system the
  agents will be launched from. Although the agents are completely implemented
  in Java, and thus will run on any platform with a Java virtual machine, there
  are subtle differences between Windows and Unix platforms when it comes to creating
  the command scripts that start the agents.  </p>
<p class="text">The command that launches each agent is shown in the &quot;Command
  Line&quot; field of each agent entry in Figure 6.1.  These are the commands
  that will be written into the scripts during the generation process.  From Figure
  6.1 it should be evident that the commands to start agents are fairly simple
  and easy to edit anyway, so the production of scripts is really just provided
  for the convenience of users.</p>

  The flow of information between an agent and a task</td>

</table>
<br>
<p class="text">
Figure 6.2 illustrates the role of tasks in relation to agents.  In the course
of interacting with other agents an agent may need to perform a task, whereupon
information is passed from agent to task.  Once in the task it can be used for
whatever purpose is required, before the information is returned to the agent
(modified or not). </p>  

<p class="text">As Figure 6.2 suggests, each task consists of three sections:
  an initial section where the information is read in from the agent, a mid-section
  where it is used and a final section when it is returned to the agent.  As agents
  are unaware of what happens inside tasks, when one is performed the agent will
  pass information into it regardless of whether it will be used or not.  Furthermore
  the agent will expect to receive information in return.  The interface between
  agent and task, i.e. the facts sent and expected back is what is specified when
  the developer describes the preconditions and effects of a task, (see activity
  <b>TASK-1</b>).  </p>
<p class="text">Consequently, of the three sections in a task the mid-section
  is optional and the first and last sections are generated by default in the
  task stub file.  This means that if the task does not need to use the information
  passed into it, the developer need not alter the task stub file.  Thus this
  activity is only relevant if the developer wishes to alter how the information
  received is used, and its scope is limited to the shaded area depicted in Figure
  6.2. </p>
<p class="text">A typical task implementation is shown in Figure 6.3; here
  the points to note are: </p>
<ul>
<li> <p class="text"> the interface
  between agent and task is the <i>exec()</i> method </p>
<li> <p class="text"> information
  is passed to the task in the form of arrays of facts. This enables multiple
  fact instances to be passed into the task when there is precondition fact whose
  cardinality is greater than 1.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> the information
  the task expects to receive, i.e. that was specified during the task definition
  process (<b>TASK-1</b>), is passed via the array <i>expInputArgs</i>.  The information
  that is <i>actually</i> received is passed via the <i>inputArgs</i> array; the
  former can be used to validate the latter.  </p>
<li> <p class="text"> the facts
  that will be returned to the agent are created inside the task using the corresponding
  expected output arguments in the <i>expOutputArgs</i> array as a template.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> the user
  code occurs after the parameters have been read from the agent and the expected
  output has been created.  In this case the task results are not being modified,
  only passed to a separate GUI frame for display.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> the created
  facts are returned to the agent by copying them into the <i>outputArgs</i> array. 
  Hence if the task is to modify the information it should be done before this
  point, otherwise the changes will not be passed to the agent.</p>

<p class="text">
 If an agent needs a resource it will first examine its local resource database,
 and if the necessary fact is not present it will consult its external resource
 database (if it has one).  These external resources are not generated by the Code
 Generator, but written by the developer to encapsulate some non-agent storage
 system, like a database or external program.  These are connected to individual
 agents by implementing the methods of the <i>zeus.actors.ExternalDb</i> interface,
 as shown in Figure 6.4. </p>   

<p class="text">To implement a new external resource interface you will need
  to create a new file in the same directory as the code for the agent that calls
  it.  The file should have the same name that was entered into the agent's External
  Database field, (see activity <a class="textlink" href="#TACF1">TACF-1</a>). </p>
<p class="text">Looking at the ExternalDb interface you will see five abstract
  methods that need to be implemented.  The first is the configuration method,
  called set, which is used to associate the external resource with its owner
  agent.  The others are 'accessor' methods that enable the agent to access the
  contents of the external resource, these are:</p>

  that enable access to the database return information in the form of strings,
  as a result the methods must create new fact objects using the attributes retrieved. 
  Also notice how the SQL commands such as &quot;select&quot; and &quot;delete

<p class="text">

<p class="text">External programs, like external resources, are linked to
  agents through an interface: in this case <i>zeus.agents.ZeusExternal.</i> 
  Thus in this context the term 'external program' is taken to mean any application
  specific code or non-agent software system that has been encapsulated by an
  implementation of this interface.  </p>
<p class="text">External Programs differ from external resources and task
  implementations in the conditions that cause them to become active and their
  duration.  External resources are typically invoked when a fact of a particular
  type was sought, and only active whilst the required information is being retrieved
  from the resource.  Likewise tasks are invoked when a particular activity is
  performed and terminate when the activity is completed.  </p>
<p class="text">By contrast, external programs are launched when the agent
  is started and may persist for as long as the agent does.  This arises from
  the fact that the external program interface was originally created to enable
  user interfaces to be connected to agents.  However external programs do not
  necessarily have to be user interfaces, since because the interface provides
  access to the agent's internal components it would be possible to link systems
  that can monitor or influence agent behaviour.     </p>
<p class="text">The key to linking an external piece of software to an agent
  is the process by which information in the external code is passed to some internal
  agent component, where it will have its effect.  This requires some knowledge
  of the interfaces of the agent components.  Whilst these interfaces are not
  hidden (you can see the agent components' methods by looking in the source code
  of the <i>zeus.actors</i> package), using the interfaces correctly does require
  some insight into the process.  This section describes some of the most typical
  interactions between agent and external program, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li> <p class="text"> <a class="textlink" href="#IMPL4A">How to instruct an agent to do something</a>, <b>(IMPL-4A)</b></p>
<li> <p class="text"> <a class="textlink" href="#IMPL4B">How to influence an agent's behaviour</a>, <b>(IMPL-4B)</b></p>

</ul>

<a name="IMPL4A"></a><h3>IMPL-4A: How to Instruct an Agent to Do Something</h3>
<p class="text">This form of interaction is obviously involved when the agent
  receives instructions from a user interface option.  (In this case the external
  program is analogous to the call-back methods commonly used in GUI programming
  to act upon GUI events). </p>
<p class="text">The actions of ZEUS agents are driven by their internal goals,
  (an approach known within AI as goal-driven behaviour); hence to issue an instruction
  to a ZEUS agent all the developer needs to do is give the agent a new goal to
  achieve.  This process is described below, and illustrated by the source code
  in Figure 6.6.  This example is taken from a manufacturing simulation and implements
  a GUI with a single button, when this is pressed a new goal will be created
  and sent to the agent instructing it to make a new 'Computer'.</p>

<p class="text"><b>Encoding Objectives</b></p>
<p class="text">A goal represents an intention to acquire some resource;
  hence to create a goal you will need to consider what resource represents the
  objective in question. Given that the application ontology has already been
  defined this should not be difficult.  Once the desired goal type has been decided,
  you can edit the source code that implements the external program interface. 
</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="text">Add a line that retrieves a description of the fact from the ontology database.  Note how
  the <i>OntologyDb</i> is accessed with the VARIABLE flag so a description of
  the fact is retrieved rather than a specific instance.  </p>
<p class="text">Once a reference to the required fact has been created you
  may wish to specify particular values for each of its attributes: this will
  restrict the specific instance obtained at runtime to satisfy the goal.  (If
  the goal fact is not refined the agent will secure any fact of the correct target
  type).    </p>
<li><p class="text">To refine the fact, use the setValue() method for each the significant attributes. </p>
<p class="text">The fact describes what needs to be achieved, but not when
  and for whom.  Thus in order to create a new goal we must specify some additional
  information.  This information may have been retrieved from a user interface,
  or may be encoded into the external program.</p>
<li><p class="text">
The constructor for goal objects has several parameters, (although not all may
be significant depending on the objective being achieved).  The first parameter
is a call to create a new unique identifier for the goal, whilst the second passes
the objective defined in the first two stages. </p>

<p class="text">The values of the other goal parameters will depend on the
  objective being achieved, and application considerations such as cost and urgency,
  they are:   </p>

<ul>
<li> <p class="text"> The next parameter
  is the <i>End Time</i>: an integer representing the latest time-grain by which
  the desired effect should be achieved.  This is most conveniently expressed
  relative to the current time-grain.  Obviously, the shorter this value the more
  urgent the goal.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> The next parameter
  is <i>Cost</i>, this is an integer value that effectively sets the budget for
  achieving the goal.  (You may remember from the task definition activity that
  tasks can have a price that their owner charges for their invocation - the interpretation
  of cost being decided by the developer).  If the cost is not significant, 0
  can be passed in this parameter.   </p>
<li> <p class="text"> The next parameter
  is <i>Priority</i>, this also takes an integer value but is currently not utilised
  during reasoning, use the default value of 1 in the meantime. </p>
<li> <p class="text"> The next parameter
  is a reference to the name of the agent that owns the goal; the name of the
  agent connected to the external interface can be obtained through the whoami()
  method.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> The final parameter
  refers to the <i>Confirm Time</i>: this is an integer representing the latest
  time-grain by which the requesting agent must inform the performing agent whether
  it has been awarded the contract.  Obviously this must be before the end time,
  and is most conveniently expressed relative to the current time.  If this is
  not important, a value of -1 can be passed.</p>
</ul>

<p class="text">Once the goal has been created it can be passed to the agents
  co-ordination engine, whereupon the agent will begin to try to satisfy the goal.
</p>
<li> <p class="text">Using the reference to the co-ordination engine contained in the Agent Context, add a line that
  will pass it the newly created goal.</p>
<p class="text">Once implemented the external program interface should be
  compiled normally. The external program's .class file should then be in same
  directory as the owning agent's .class file.</p>

<a name="IMPL4B"></a><h3>IMPL-4B: How to Influence an Agents Behaviour</h3>
<p class="text">
 This means of affecting agent behaviour differs subtly from the goal-driven 
 approach, and is only applicable to agents who possess a knowledge base of 
 rules.  The rule base is a collection of pattern-action rules, when a fact 
 is found that matches an existing pattern, the associated action is 
 performed.  Hence this approach involves supplying the agent with facts 
 that will deliberately trigger a response in the agent, this is known as 
 data-driven behaviour. <br>
 <br>
 Whilst <a href="part3.html#RULE1" class="textlink">activity RULE-1</a> describes how to associate rules with
 agents, it does not describe how the external program can be used trigger
 these rules to influence the agent's behaviour; it is this aspect that it
 dealt with here. <br>
 <br>
 As rules are triggered by the presence of certain facts or variables in the
 Resource Database, the simplest way to influence an agent's behaviour is to 
 create the appropriate fact within the agent's external program code and 
 add it to the Resource Database directly.  This process is illustrated with 
 the excerpt of source code shown below:
</p>

<center>
<img src="./gfx/image113.gif"><br>
</center>

<p class="text">The description of the <a href="part3.html#RULE1" class="textlink">activity RULE-1</a> 
 also explains the possible actions that can be invoked when the rule fires. </p>

<br>
<a name="IMPL4C"></a><h3>IMPL-4C: How to Access an Agents Resources</h3>
<p class="text">One good reason for wanting to access an agent's resource
  is to inspect its values.  For instance, an external program such as a user
  interface may be used to read and display the attributes of particular resources. 
  Alternatively, you may want modify a resource by changing some of its attributes. 
  This is a much quicker means of changing an agent's internal state than the
  usual means of sending a message to the agent.  Hence this is activity is particularly

  <p class="text"> This code is taken from
  the implementation of a panel that has a label that displays the amount of money
  currently possessed by the agent.  The panel also has a withdrawal button, which
  when pressed will reset the amount of money held by the agent.  The labels in
  Figure 6.7 are explained below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p class="text">The moneyPanel class is created, note
  how it is passed a reference to the AgentContext object of the agent who's resources
  it will display.  The AgentContext object will have been passed by a class that
  implements the ZeusExternal interface, (see activity <a class="textlink" href="#IMPL4A">IMPL-4A</a>).</p>
<li><p class="text">The moneyPanel class registers its
  interest in ADD fact events that occur within the ResourceDb, (this requires
  that it implement the methods of the FactMonitor interface).  ADD events will
  be triggered when new facts are added to the ResourceDb or existing facts are
  modified.   </p>
<li><p class="text">The Money fact is read from the ResourceDb,
  and its value used to initialise the label that displays the amount of money
  owned by the agent.  These lines assume that the agent only has one resource
  of type 'Money', hence the first element of the array that is returned is used.</p>
<li><p class="text">The actionPerformed method is called
  when the withdrawal button is pressed, whereupon the reference to the amount
  of money held by the agent is obtained from the ResourceDb.</p>
<li><p class="text">Setting the Money fact's number attribute
  to 0 and using it to replace the existing Money resource effectively resets
  the amount of money held by the agent.  It will also cause a fact change event
  to be triggered.</p>
<li><p class="text">The factAddedEvent method is triggered
  by the change that occurs in the ResourceDb as a result of (5).  In response
  the money resource is re-read from the ResourceDb and the display label is updated
  with the new value.   </p>
</ol>

<a name="IMPL4B"></a><h3>IMPL-5: How to Implement a new Interaction Strategy</h3>
<p>This will be documented in a future release.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In the meantime you may want to consider the sample
  negotiation strategies supplied with the toolkit: SimpleInitiatorEvaluator and
  SimpleRespondentEvaluator, which are implemented in the eponymous files found
  in the zeus.actors.graphs package.  These provide a template from which custom
  strategies can be created.</p>

<br>
<h4>Running the Application</h4>
<p class="text">Once the agents and any task bodies, external resources and
  external programs have been implemented and compiled, the next stage is to distribute
  the agents to their host machines and launch them.  This process and the facilities
  of the Visualisation tools that can be used to inspect and interact with them
  are described in the final document: the ZEUS Runtime Guide.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p class="text">This document has described the activities necessary
  to convert an agent design into a functioning agent.  It is part agent cookbook
  and part ZEUS Generator user manual, providing both a reference of useful expertise
  that developers can consult to find answers to application implementation problems,
  whilst also advising how the problem can be solved using the ZEUS Agent Generator. 
  As these solutions become familiar experienced developers will probably consult
  less document less frequently.   </p>
<p class="text"> The current release still has gaps where toolkit functionality 
 is yet to be documented, these should be filled in time. If you'd like to 
 contribute to the documentation project, let me know. And of course, all 
 errors, comments or suggestions are welcomed. </p>
