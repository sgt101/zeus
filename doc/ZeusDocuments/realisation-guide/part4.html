<p class="text">By now the task-specific agents will have been defined, leaving
  us to consider the agents that will provide the support infrastructure: these
  are known as the utility agents.  This stage requires that the following design
  decisions should have already been taken: </p>
<ul>
<li> <p class="text"> how the name resolution service will be realised</p>
<li> <p class="text"> whether there will be a Facilitator, and if so, what are its attributes</p>
<li> <p class="text"> whether there will be a Visualiser</p>
<li> <p class="text"> whether agent activity will be stored persistently</p>
</ul>
<p class="text"> The number and nature of the utility agents needed is dependent on the application. 
  The Role Modelling guide and its case studies provide examples of how to configure
  utility agents appropriately. Each type of utility agent can be configured through
  the 'Utility Agent' pane of the Code Generator window.  
</p>
<p class="text"><img width=32 height=32 src="./gfx/image067.gif"> &nbsp;
  To open the Code Generator tool select the &quot;Generate Code&quot; menu option or the equivalent button
  from the Project Options toolbar.  You will now be able to perform the main
  activities of this stage, namely:</p>

<p class="text">
  An agent society must possess at least one Agent Name Server (ANS).  The ANSs
  maintain a registry of known agents, enabling them to map agent identities to
  a logical network location.  This is necessary because agents only know the
  names of their acquaintances and not their locations.  Name Server agents are
  created and configured using the 'Name Servers' panel, as shown in Figure 4.1.

<br>
<p class="text">By default the Name Servers table has one entry, referring
  to a single ANS agent, this should suffice for small agent societies.  However
  as the ANS is vital to all agent communication it is a potential bottleneck,
  and so it may be desirable to have multiple ANSs to support larger societies,
  or to provide a degree of redundancy in case one fails.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> <img width=32 height=16 src="./gfx/image016.gif"> &nbsp; To add
  another ANS, click the New button, this will create another entry in the table
  that can be edited as required.</p>
<p class="text"> The Host field shows the I.P address (i.e. network location)
  of the machine that the ANS will run on, this defaults to the I.P address of
  the machine that is currently running the Generator tool.  More than one ANS
  can reside on a single host. </p>
<p class="text"> To change the location of
  the ANS double click on the Host field and enter the new value. If you don't
  know the I.P address of machine, use the ping command to discover it.</p>
<p class="text">If there is more than one ANS the developer can choose which
  is the root server, the only operational difference of changing this is the
  root server will provide the time-grain value (see below) and be responsible
  for maintaining the society-wide clock. </p>
<li> <p class="text"> To select or deselect an agent as the root, click on the 
 'Is Root?' field. Note: one ANS must be selected as the root.</p>
<p class="text">The agent selected as the root will provide the time-grain
  value for the entire society, (for a discussion of the time-grain and its implications
  see section 3 of this document).    </p>
<li> <p class="text"> Change
  the time-grain by double clicking the Time Grain field, the new value should
  be expressed in minutes and be a non-negative real number. For instance to set
  the time-grain to 20 seconds 0.33 should be entered.  Note: only the time grain
  field of the root ANS can be edited.  </p>
<p class="text">As the root ANS serves as a reference point for all other
  agents in the society, there must be a means to inform other agents where the
  root ANS is located.  Hence when the root ANS starts, it will write its network
  location into a file called the Default Name Server (DNS) file.  If agents share
  a network file system it is recommended that the DNS file be expressed in terms
  of a network pathname.    </p>
<li> <p class="text"> To edit
  the pathname to which the root ANS will write the DNS, double click on the Address
  File field of the root agent. </p>
<p class="text">To make non-root name servers aware of the root ANS, they
  must be told where to find the root's DNS file.  This pathname is entered into
  the DNS File field.  If this is not a network accessible file, it will need
  to be copied to the local file system of the agent concerned, and hence this
  field will contain its local pathname and filename. </p>
<li> <p class="text"> To edit
  the pathname from which the DNS file will be read, double click on the DNS File
  field of the root agent. </p>
<p class="text">The developer can choose whether Agent Name Servers will
  be created with a graphical user interface, (GUI).  The GUI will display information
  on the server's activity, and provide some control functions.  This may be useful
  for debugging and monitoring, but unnecessary if the ANS is to run in the background.</p>

<p class="text">
 Whereas every agent society must have an ANS, there is no such obligation for
 Facilitators.  Whether Facilitators are included depends on the nature of the
 application; if all agent acquaintances and abilities have been determined at
 design-time and will not change, then a Facilitator may not be necessary.  However,
 this situation is unlikely, and so most applications will possess at least one
 Facilitator, which can be created and configured using the 'Facilitators' panel,
 as shown in Figure 4.2. </p>

<p class="text"><b>How to Make the Facilitator Reactive</b></p>
<p class="text">The normal behaviour of a Facilitator is to retrieve the
  list of known agents from an ANS, and then send a message to each of the agents
  asking them to reply with details of the abilities they are currently able to
  perform.  The interval between these queries is set through the Recycle Period
  field.</p>
<li> <p class="text"> Change
  the cycle interval by double clicking the Recycle Period field, the new value
  should be expressed in minutes and be a non-negative real number.  </p>
<p class="text">If the cycle period is set to 0 the Facilitator will cease
  its proactive querying of agents and become totally reactive.  In this case
  the normal roles are reversed and the agents must behave proactively, periodically
  advertising their abilities to the Facilitator.  This will require altering
  the agent's normal behaviour, (see <a href="part6.html#imp4a" class="textlink">
  How to Instruct an Agent to Do Something</a>).</p>

<p class="text">
 Like Facilitators, there is no requirement for an application to contain a Visualiser.
 Whether one is included depends on whether the application is to be debugged,
 monitored or analysed.  Given the Visualiser offers some very useful functionality
 for free it will usually be included in the list of agents to be created.  Visualisers
 are created and configured using the 'Visualisers' panel, shown in Figure 4.3.</p>

<p class="text">By default the Visualisers table has one entry, whether more
  than one is necessary will probably depend on the number of locations where
  users will want to visualise some aspect of the society. Another influencing

  and so as the implications of failure are less serious there is less need for
  redundancy.</p>

  A Database Proxy (DP) agent provides Visualiser agents with a means of persistent
