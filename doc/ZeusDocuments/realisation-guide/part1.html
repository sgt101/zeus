<h3><a name="1"></a>1        Introduction</a></h3>

<p class="text">The agent realisation process follows the design stage of
  the ZEUS agent development methodology.  During the course of this guide
  the realisation process will be methodically described as a series of 
  development stages, each of which consists of individual activities that
  implement particular aspects of an agent.</p>
<p class="text">A prerequisite for using this document is a design for the
  application being realised.  In addition the developer should know when and
  how to perform the necessary activities.  We have tried to capture this expertise
  in the Case Studies document, which provides worked examples that we feel best
  illustrate how to implement working agent applications.</p>
<p class="text">But before we consider how to implement an agent, we need
  to consider the conceptual basis of agents created with the ZEUS toolkit.</p>

<a name="11"></a><h4>1.1     The Conceptual Zeus Agent</h4>

<p class="text">At the highest level of abstraction, the ZEUS agent design approach requires developers
to view an agent as a five-layered entity, as illustrated in Figure 1.1 below. </p>

<b>Figure 1.1</b>: The Conceptual Structure of a ZEUS Agent</p> 
<br>
<br>
<p class="text">From the bottom up, these layers are: </p>
<ul>
<li><p class="text">an interface layer, which enables the agent to be linked to the external programs
  that provide it with resources and/or implement its competencies</p>
<li><p class="text">a <i>definition layer</i>, where the agent is viewed as an autonomous reasoning entity</p>
<li><p class="text">an <i>organisation layer</i>, where the agent is viewed in terms of its relationships
  with other agents</p>
<li><p class="text">a <i>co-ordination</i> layer, where the agent is viewed as a social entity that
  interacts according to its known protocols and strategies</p>
<li><p class="text">a <i>communication layer</i>, which implements the protocols and mechanisms that support
  inter-agent communication</p>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="text">The <i>Interface</i> layer receives input via its sensors
  and is able to change the outside world through its effectors.  For instance,
  a sensor could receive instructions from a GUI or act by modifying a database,
  thus providing physical realisations of the agents' resources and skills.  As
  the sensors and effectors are external to the agent, configuration of the Interface
  layer consists of specifying interfaces between them and the agent. </p>
<p class="text">At the <i>Definition</i> layer the agent is viewed as an
  autonomous rational entity, in terms of its reasoning abilities, goals, resources, 
  skills, beliefs and preferences.  As this layer is physically realised by classes 
  from the ZEUS Agent Component library, (described in the Technical Manual), 
  this stage of the methodology involves the configuration of these components.  
</p>
<p class="text">At the <i>Organisation</i> layer the agent is viewed in terms
  of its relationships with other agents.  This introduces the concept of an agency 
  - a group of related agents.  Agencies may be real, in that they are related 
  by virtue of common attribute, such as being part of the same company.  Or agencies 
  may be virtual, in that their constituents share a co-operation agreement.  
  Thus this stage of the methodology involves configuring the agent in terms of 
  the agency it belongs to, what roles it plays with the agency, what other agents 
  it is aware of, and what abilities it knows others possess.</p>
<p class="text">At the <i>Co-ordination</i> layer the agent is considered
  to be a social entity, hence this stage involves configuring it for the desired 
  forms of social behaviour.  This is achieved by equipping it with the appropriate 
  negotiation protocols and strategies.  </p>
<p class="text">The <i>Communication</i> layer provides a transport protocol
  and language enabling agents to send messages to each other.  For compatibility 
  this layer should be the same in each agent, and so there no need for developers 
  to configure this layer.</p>
<p class="text">This document will explain the process by which this conceptual
  agent is configured into functional member of a multi-agent society.  This configuration 
  process will be accomplished using the ZEUS Agent Generator tool, which will 
  ultimately generate the agent source code.  The developer need only implement 
  the agents' application-specific functionality, and link it to the agents using 
  the interfaces provided. </p>

<h4>1.2     An Overview of the Agent Realisation Process</h4>

<p class="text">The objective of this process is to realise working agent
  implementations from conceptual designs created during the previous stage. 
  The agent realisation process consists of several stages, (some of which have
  been derived from the levels of abstraction that exist within a ZEUS agent as
  shown in Figure 1.1).  The stages and the order in which they should be attempted 
  are: </p>
<p class="text"><b>Stage 1: Ontology Creation</b></p>
<p class="text">Before implementing any agents the developer must define
  the application ontology: the declarative knowledge that represents the significant 
  concepts within the application domain.  The tool used to enter this information 
  is the ZEUS Ontology Editor.  Or alternatively, an existing ontology can be
  imported.</p>
<p style='
text-align:justify'><b>Stage 2: Agent Creation</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>During this stage the generic ZEUS agent is configured 
  to fulfil its application-specific responsibilities, returning in a task agent.  
  This process involves the ZEUS Agent Editor to complete up to four sub-stages
  (depending on the nature of the agent); these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="text">Agent Definition
  - where its tasks, initial resources and planning abilities are specified </p>
<li><p class="text">Task Description
  - where the applicability and attributes of agent activities are specified </p>
<li><p class="text">Agent Organisation
  - where the social context of each agent is specified</p>
<li><p class="text">Agent Co-ordination
  - where each agent is equipped with the social abilities for interaction</p>
</ul>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b>Stage 3: Utility Agent Configuration</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Whereas the previous section concerned the agents
  who performed the application-specific activities this stage defines the attributes 
  of the utility agents who provide the support infrastructure for the agent society.  
  This information is entered through the Code Generation Editor in readiness 
  for the creation of the utility agents. </p>
<p style='
text-align:justify'><b>Stage 4: Task Agent Configuration</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>This stage enables the runtime parameters of the 
  task agents to be specified.  This involves supplying information such as the 
  host machines the agents will run on, and the external resources and programs 
  to which the agents will be linked. </p>
<p style='
text-align:justify'><b>Stage 5: Agent Implementation</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>At this stage the Code Generator can be invoked 
  and agent source code automatically generated.  This leaves the developer with 
  the job of providing the application-specific implementations of the tasks, 
  external resources, programs (such as agent user interfaces) and interaction 
  strategies.  When this stage has been completed the application is ready to 
  be run.</p>
<p class="text">Each of these stages is the subject of the remaining sections
  of this document.  Each section contains various activities that describe how 
  to configure aspects of the generic ZEUS agent.  For instance, the Co-ordination 
  section describes how to solve the problem of engaging in a dialogue with another 
  agent (the solution being to equip agent with an appropriate co-ordination protocol).  
</p>
<p class="text">These problem/solution entries are referred to in the Case
  Studies that accompany the Role Modelling Guide.  If you are reading this document 
  for the first time it is recommended that you read this guide and one of the 
  associated case studies before proceeding further.</p>

<a name="13"></a><h4>1.3     Getting Started</a></h4>

<p class="text">All the stages of the realisation process are achieved through
  the ZEUS Agent Generator tool.  The Generator is run through the Java runtime
  environment, which should be version 1.2 or later (due to the class libraries
  required).  The presence of a JRE can be easily tested by typing 'java -version'
  into your machine's command line, if it is installed correctly you will see
  a message reporting the version of the JRE installed on that machine.  Otherwise
  you will need to install the JRE (or make it accessible) before proceeding.  
</p>
<p class="text">You should also ensure that the JRE's CLASSPATH environment
  variable contains a reference to the directory that contains the zeus class
  package.  The state of this variable can be seen by typing SETENV on UNIX machines,
  or SET on PCs.  There should also be a ZEUS properties file in the appropriate
  location, (for more detailed instructions, see the Installation guide). </p>

<p class="text"> Now start the Generator by entering the following command:</p>
<p><tt>java zeus.generator.AgentGenerator</tt></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>If ZEUS has been installed properly a window should
  appear entitled 'ZEUS Agent Generator'.  If not, consult the trouble-shooting
  section of the installation guide. </p>
<p class="text">The Generator window serves as the launching point
  for the various agent building windows, it consists of four panels that enable
  access to its functions, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="text"> <b>Project Options</b> -
  this panel contains a toolbar of management options, enabling whole projects
  to be loaded, saved and cleared.  The other buttons launch the Society Viewer
  and Code Generator tools.  Beneath is the filename of the project currently
  in memory. </p>
<li><p class="text"> <b>Ontology Options - </b>this
  panel provides access to the Ontology Editor tool, enabling ontologies to be
  loaded, saved, cleared and edited.  The name of the ontology currently in memory
  is shown beneath the toolbar.</p>
<li><p class="text"> <b>Agent Options</b> - this
  panel consists of a toolbar and a table that lists all the agents in the currently
  loaded project.  The options available from here are described in <a class="textlink" href="part3.html">Section 3</a>. </p>
<li><p class="text"> <b>Task Options</b> - this
  panel consists of a toolbar and a table that lists all the tasks in the currently
  loaded project.  The options available from here are also described in <a class="textlink" href="part3.html">Section 3</a>.   </p>
</ul>
<p class="text">The subsequent sections describe how the facilities
  of the Generator tool support the stages of the ZEUS agent creation methodology.</p>
