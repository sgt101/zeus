Zeus Documents - 12/03/01

What is in this directory?
--------------------------

This directory contains the documentation for the Zeus toolkit.

The file documents.html provides an index to the user documentation.

The files Zconcepts.doc and Zconcepts.pdf provide a conceptual introduction to the ideas
that the open source version Zeus is based on, and embodies.

The file zeus.mdl contains a rational rose model of zeus as it was during the 1.1 development
process. However, this model is rather obsolete now (perhaps someone could do a new one?)

The file Zsh.doc provides some instructions for using the zsh shell supplied with Zeus.
