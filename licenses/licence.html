</UL>

<P>
<B>3. Distribution Obligations.</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>3.1. Application of Licence.</B> <BR>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this Licence, including without limitation
Section <B>2.2</B>. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
be distributed only under the terms of this Licence or a future
version of this Licence released under Section <B>6.1</B>, and
You must include a copy of this Licence with every copy of the
Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this Licence or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,
You may include an additional document offering the additional
rights described in Section <B>3.5</B>.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</B> <BR>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
Licence either on the same media as an Executable version or via
an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
you made an Executable version available; and if made available
via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
<LI><B>3.3. Description of Modifications.</B> <BR>
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and
(b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
<LI><B>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</B> 
<LI><B>(a) Third Party Claims</B>. <BR>
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
right in particular functionality or code (or its utilisation
under this Licence), you must include a text file with the source
code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the
claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that
a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
<B>3.2</B>, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such
as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that
new knowledge has been obtained.
<LI><B>(b) Contributor APIs</B>. <BR>
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement
that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL
file.
<LI><B>3.5. Required Notices.</B> <BR>
You must duplicate the notice in <B>Exhibit A</B> in each file
of the Source Code, and this Licence in any documentation for
the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating
to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You
may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
<B>Exhibit A</B>. If it is not possible to put such notice in
a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
or liability terms You offer.
<LI><B>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</B> <BR>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Section <B>3.1-3.5</B> have been met for that
Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
of this Licence, including a description of how and where You
have fulfilled the obligations of Section <B>3.2</B>. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
the Executable version of Covered Code under a Licence of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this Licence, provided
that You are in compliance with the terms of this Licence and
that the Licence for the Executable version does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
from the rights set forth in this Licence. If You distribute the
Executable version under a different Licence You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this Licence
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
offer.
<LI><B>3.7. Larger Works.</B> <BR>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
code not governed by the terms of this Licence and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
make sure the requirements of this Licence are fulfilled for the
Covered Code.
</UL>

<P>
<B>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</B> 
<UL>
<LI>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms
of this Licence with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
terms of this Licence to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section <B>3.4</B>
and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
</UL>

<P>
<B>5. Application of this Licence.</B> 
<UL>
<LI>This Licence applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in <B>Exhibit A</B>, and to related Covered
Code.
</UL>

<P>
<B>6. Versions of the Licence.</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>6.1. New Versions</B>. <BR>
BT may publish revised and/or new versions of the Licence from
time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>6.2. Effect of New Versions</B>. <BR>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version
of the Licence, You may always continue to use it under the terms
of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the Licence published
by BT. No one other than BT has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this Licence.
<LI><B>6.3. Derivative Works</B>. <BR>
If you create or use a modified version of this Licence (which
you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
Covered Code governed by this Licence), the phrases &quot;BT&quot;,
&quot;British Telecommunications&quot; or &quot;ZEUS&quot; or
any confusingly similar phrase must not appear anywhere in your
Licence in such as way as to suggest a connection between the
subject matter of Your Licence and these expressions or the entities
they represent. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <B>Exhibit
A</B> shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
this Licence.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</B> 
<LI>THE INITIAL DEVELOPER AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR WARRANTS THAT IT
HAS THE RIGHT TO GRANT THE LICENCES CONTAINED HEREIN UNDER THE

IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
OR NON-INFRINGING OF OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENCE.
NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORISED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
THIS DISCLAIMER.

<P>
<B>8. TERMINATION.</B> 
<UL>
<LI>8.1 This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this Licence. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
of this Licence shall survive.
<LI>8.2. If You initiate patent infringement litigation against
the Initial Developer or a Contributor (either hereinafter referred
to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that such Participant's
Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant
to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon
60 days notice from Participant terminate, unless within the 60
days You either:
<LI>(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of the Original
Code or the Modifications made by such Participant, or
<LI>(ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Original
Code or the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within
60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement
are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant
to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at
the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
<LI>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant's Original Code or Contributor
Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to
the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
or value of any payment or license.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors
and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
</UL>

<P>
<B>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</B> 
<UL>
<LI>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE

COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,

<LI>This Licence represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Licence is held
